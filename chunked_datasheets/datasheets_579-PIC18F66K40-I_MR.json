    "2. Device Overview\nThis document contains device specific information for the following devices:\n\u2022 PIC18F65K40, 1 = \u2022 PIC18LF65K40. \u2022 PIC18F66K40, 1 = \u2022 PIC18LF66K40\nThis family offers the advantages of all PIC18 microcontrollers - namely, high computational performance at an economical price - with the addition of high-endurance Program Flash Memory. In addition to these features, the PIC18(L)F65/66K40 family introduces design enhancements that make these microcontrollers a logical choice for many high-performance, power sensitive applications.",
    "2.1.1 XLP Technology\nAll of the devices in the PIC18(L)F65/66K40 family incorporate a range of features that can significantly reduce power consumption during operation. Key items include:\n\u00b7 Alternate Run Modes: By clocking the controller from the secondary oscillator or the internal oscillator block, power consumption during code execution can be reduced by as much as 90%.\n\u00b7 Multiple Idle Modes: The controller can also run with its CPU core disabled but the peripherals still active. In these states, power consumption can be reduced even further, to as little as 4% of normal operation requirements.\n\u00b7 On-the-fly Mode Switching: The power-managed modes are invoked by user code during operation, allowing the user to incorporate power-saving ideas into their application's software design.\n\u00b7 Peripheral Module Disable: Modules that are not being used in the code can be selectively disabled using the PMD module. This further reduces the power consumption.",
    "2.1.2 Multiple Oscillator Options and Features\nAll of the devices in the PIC18(L)F65/66K40family offer several different oscillator options. The PIC18(L)F65/66K40 family can be clocked from several different sources:\n\u00b7 HFINTOSC\n-1-64 MHz precision digitally controlled internal oscillator\n\u00b7 LFINTOSC\n-31 kHz internal oscillator\n\u00b7 EXTOSC\n-External clock (EC)\n-Low-power oscillator (LP)\n-Medium power oscillator (XT)\n-High-power oscillator (HS)\n\u00b7 SOSC\n-Secondary oscillator circuit optimized for 31 kHz clock crystals\n\u00b7 A Phase Lock Loop (PLL) frequency multiplier (4x) is available to the External Oscillator modes enabling clock speeds of up to 64 MHz\n- \u00b7 Fail-Safe Clock Monitor: This option constantly monitors the main clock source against a reference signal provided by the LFINTOSC. If a clock failure occurs, the controller is switched to the internal oscillator block, allowing for continued operation or a safe application shutdown.",
    "2.2 Other Special Features\n\u00b7 Memory Endurance: The Flash cells for both program memory and data EEPROM are rated to last for many thousands of erase/write cycles - up to 10K for program memory and 100K for EEPROM. Data retention without refresh is conservatively estimated to be greater than 40 years.\n\u00b7 Self-programmability: These devices can write to their own program memory spaces under internal software control. By using a boot loader routine located in the protected Boot Block at the top of program memory, it becomes possible to create an application that can update itself in the field.\n\u00b7 Extended Instruction Set: The PIC18(L)F65/66K40 family includes an optional extension to the PIC18 instruction set, which adds eight new instructions and an Indexed Addressing mode. This extension, enabled as a device configuration option, has been specifically designed to optimize re-entrant application code originally developed in high-level languages, such as C.\n\u00b7 Enhanced Peripheral Pin Select: The Peripheral Pin Select (PPS) module connects peripheral inputs and outputs to the device I/O pins. Only digital signals are included in the selections. All analog inputs and outputs remain fixed to their assigned pins.",
    "2.2 Other Special Features\n\u00b7 Enhanced Addressable EUSART: This serial communication module is capable of standard RS-232 operation and provides support for the LIN bus protocol. Other enhancements include automatic baud rate detection and a 16-bit Baud Rate Generator for improved resolution. When the microcontroller is using the internal oscillator block, the EUSART provides stable operation for applications that talk to the outside world without using an external crystal (or its accompanying power requirement).\n\u00b7 10-bit Analog-to-Digital (ADC) with Computation: This module incorporates programmable acquisition time, allowing for a channel to be selected and a conversion to be initiated without waiting for a sampling period and thus, reduce code overhead. It has a new module called Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADCC), which provides a digital filter and threshold interrupt functions.\n\u00b7 Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT):\n-Timer monitoring of overflow and underflow events\n-Variable prescaler selection\n-Variable window size selection\n-All sources configurable in hardware or software",

    "2.4.1 Register Names\nWhen there are multiple instances of the same peripheral in a device, the Peripheral Control registers will be depicted as the concatenation of a peripheral identifier, peripheral instance, and control identifier. The control registers section will show just one instance of all the register names with an 'x' in the place of the peripheral instance number. This naming convention may also be applied to peripherals when there is only one instance of that peripheral in the device to maintain compatibility with other devices in the family that contain more than one.",
    "2.4.2 Bit Names\nThere are two variants for bit names:\n\u00b7 Short name: Bit function abbreviation\n\u00b7 Long name: Peripheral abbreviation + short name",
    "2.4.2.1 Short Bit Names\nShort bit names are an abbreviation for the bit function. For example, some peripherals are enabled with the EN bit. The bit names shown in the registers are the short name variant.\nShort bit names are useful when accessing bits in C programs. The general format for accessing bits by the short name is RegisterNamebits.ShortName. For example, the enable bit, EN, in the CM1CON0 register can be set in C programs with the instruction CM1CON0bits.EN = 1 .\nShort names are not useful in assembly programs because the same name may be used by different peripherals in different bit positions. When this occurs, during the include file generation, all instances of that short bit name are appended with an underscore plus the name of the register in which the bit resides to avoid naming contentions.",
    "2.4.2.2 Long Bit Names\nLong bit names are constructed by adding a peripheral abbreviation prefix to the short name. The prefix is unique to the peripheral, thereby making every long bit name unique. The long bit name for the COG1 enable bit is the COG1 prefix, G1, appended with the enable bit short name, EN, resulting in the unique bit name G1EN.\nImportant: The COG1 peripheral is used as an example. Not all devices have the COG peripheral.\nLong bit names are useful in both C and assembly programs. For example, in C the COG1CON0 enable bit can be set with the G1EN = 1 instruction. In assembly, this bit can be set with the BSF COG1CON0,G1EN instruction.",
    "2.4.2.3 Bit Fields\nBit fields are two or more adjacent bits in the same register. Bit fields adhere only to the short bit naming convention. For example, the three Least Significant bits of the COG1CON0 register contain the Mode Control bits. The short name for this field is MD. There is no long bit name variant. Bit field access is only possible in C programs. The following example demonstrates a C program instruction for setting the COG1 to the Push-Pull mode:\nCOG1CON0bits.MD = 0x5;\nIndividual bits in a bit field can also be accessed with long and short bit names. Each bit is the field name appended with the number of the bit position within the field. For example, the Most Significant mode bit has the short bit name MD2 and the long bit name is G1MD2. The following two examples demonstrate assembly program sequences for setting the COG1 to Push-Pull mode:\nMOVLW  ~(1<<G1MD1)\nANDWF  COG1CON0,F\nMOVLW  1<<G1MD2 | 1<<G1MD0\nIORWF  COG1CON0,F",
    "Example 2-2.\nBSF    COG1CON0,G1MD2\nBCF    COG1CON0,G1MD1\nBSF    COG1CON0,G1MD0",
    "2.4.3.1 Status, Interrupt, and Mirror Bits\nStatus, interrupt enables, Interrupt flags, and Mirror bits are contained in registers that span more than one peripheral. In these cases, the bit name shown is unique so there is no prefix or short name variant.",
    "2.4.3.2 Legacy Peripherals\nThere are some peripherals that do not strictly adhere to these naming conventions. Peripherals that have existed for many years and are present in almost every device are the exceptions. These exceptions were necessary to limit the adverse impact of the new conventions on legacy code.

    "3.1 Basic Connection Requirements\nGetting started with the PIC18(L)F65/66K40 family of 8-bit microcontrollers requires attention to a minimal set of device pin connections before proceeding with development.\nThe following pins must always be connected:\n\u00b7 All V DD and VSS pins (see Power Supply Pins)\n\u00b7 MCLR pin (see Master Clear (MCLR) Pin)\nThese pins must also be connected if they are being used in the end application:",

    "3.2.1 Decoupling Capacitors\nThe use of decoupling capacitors on every pair of power supply pins (VDD and VSS) is required.\nConsider the following criteria when using decoupling capacitors:\n\u00b7 Value and type of capacitor: A 0.1 \u03bcF (100 nF), 10-20V capacitor is recommended. The capacitor must be a low-ESR device, with a resonance frequency in the range of 200 MHz and higher. Ceramic capacitors are recommended.\n\u00b7 Placement on the printed circuit board: The decoupling capacitors must be placed as close to the pins as possible. It is recommended to place the capacitors on the same side of the board as the device. If space is constricted, the capacitor can be placed on another layer on the PCB using a\nvia; however, ensure that the trace length from the pin to the capacitor is no greater than 0.25 inch (6 mm).",
    "3.2.1 Decoupling Capacitors\n\u00b7 Handling high-frequency noise: If the board is experiencing high-frequency noise (upward of tens of MHz), add a second ceramic type capacitor in parallel to the above described decoupling capacitor. The value of the second capacitor can be in the range of 0.01 \u03bcF to 0.001 \u03bcF. Place this second capacitor next to each primary decoupling capacitor. In high-speed circuit designs, consider implementing a decade pair of capacitances as close to the power and ground pins as possible (e.g., 0.1 \u03bcF in parallel with 0.001 \u03bcF).\n\u00b7 Maximizing performance: On the board layout from the power supply circuit, run the power and return traces to the decoupling capacitors first, and then to the device pins. This ensures that the decoupling capacitors are first in the power chain. Equally important is to keep the trace length between the capacitor and the power pins to a minimum, thereby reducing PCB trace inductance.",
    "3.2.2 Tank Capacitors\nOn boards with power traces running longer than six inches in length, it is suggested to use a tank capacitor for integrated circuits, including microcontrollers, to supply a local power source. The value of the tank capacitor may be determined based on the trace resistance that connects the power supply source to the device, and the maximum current drawn by the device in the application. In other words, select the tank capacitor that meets the acceptable voltage sag at the device. Typical values range from 4.7 \u03bcF to 47 \u03bcF.",
    "3.3 Master Clear (MCLR) Pin\nThe MCLR pin provides two specific device functions: Device Reset, and Device Programming and Debugging. If programming and debugging are not required in the end application, a direct connection to VDD may be all that is required. The addition of other components, to help increase the application's resistance to spurious Resets from voltage sags, may be beneficial. A typical configuration is shown in Figure 3-1. Other circuit designs may be implemented, depending on the application's requirements.\nDuring programming and debugging, the resistance and capacitance that can be added to the pin must be considered. Device programmers and debuggers drive the MCLR pin. Consequently, specific voltage levels (V IH and VIL ) and fast signal transitions must not be adversely affected. Therefore, specific values of R1 and C1 will need to be adjusted based on the application and PCB requirements. For example, it is recommended that the capacitor, C1, be isolated from the MCLR pin during programming and debugging operations by using a jumper (Figure 3-2). The jumper is replaced for normal run-time operations.",

Ensure that the MCLR pin VIH and VIL specifications are met.",
    "3.4 In-Circuit Serial Programming \u2122 (ICSP \u2122 ) Pins\nThe ICSPCLK and ICSPDAT pins are used for ICSP and debugging purposes. It is recommended to keep the trace length between the ICSP connector and the ICSP pins on the device as short as possible. If the ICSP connector is expected to experience an ESD event, a series resistor is recommended, with the value in the range of a few tens of Ohms, not to exceed 100\u03a9.\nPull-up resistors, series diodes and capacitors on the ICSPCLK and ICSPDAT pins are not recommended as they can interfere with the programmer/debugger communications to the device. If such discrete components are an application requirement, they must be removed from the circuit during programming and debugging. Alternatively, refer to the AC/DC characteristics and timing requirements information in the respective device Flash programming specification for information on capacitive loading limits, and pin input voltage high (V IH ) and input low (V IL ) requirements.",
    "3.4 In-Circuit Serial Programming \u2122 (ICSP \u2122 ) Pins\nFor device emulation, ensure that the Communication Channel Select (i.e., ICSPCLK/ICSPDAT pins), programmed into the device, matches the physical connections for the ICSP to the Microchip debugger/emulator tool.\nFor more information, refer to the In-Circuit Serial Programming Guide.",
    "3.5 External Oscillator Pins\nMany microcontrollers have options for at least two oscillators: A high-frequency primary oscillator and a low-frequency secondary oscillator.\nThe oscillator circuit must be placed on the same side of the board as the device. Place the oscillator circuit close to the respective oscillator pins with no more than 0.5 inch (12 mm) between the circuit components and the pins. The load capacitors must be placed next to the oscillator itself, on the same side of the board.\nUse a grounded copper pour around the oscillator circuit to isolate it from surrounding circuits. The grounded copper pour may be routed directly to the MCU ground. Do not run any signal traces or power traces inside the ground pour. Also, if using a two-sided board, avoid any traces on the other side of the board where the crystal is placed.",
    "3.5 External Oscillator Pins\nLayout suggestions are shown in the following figure. In-line packages may be handled with a single-sided layout that completely encompasses the oscillator pins. With fine-pitch packages, it is not always possible to completely surround the pins and components. A suitable solution is to tie the broken guard sections to a mirrored ground layer. In all cases, the guard trace(s) must be returned to ground.\nFigure 3-3. Suggested Placement of the Oscillator Circuit\nRev. 30-000059A",

To avoid possible glitches, clock dividers and clock duty cycles may be changed only when the EN bit is clear.",

However, to prevent glitches on the output, the DIV bits may be only changed when the module is disabled (EN = 0 ).",
    "6.3 Selectable Duty Cycle\nThe DC bits in the CLKRCON register are used to modify the duty cycle of the output clock. A duty cycle of 0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% can be selected for all clock rates when the DIV value is not 000 . When DIV = 000 , the duty cycle defaults to 50% for all values of DC except 00 , in which case the duty cycle is 0% (constant low output).\nImportant: The DC value at Reset is 10 . This makes the default duty cycle 50% and not 0%.\nImportant: Clock dividers and clock duty cycles can be changed while the module is enabled but doing so may cause glitches to occur on the output. To avoid possible glitches, clock dividers and clock duty cycles may be changed only when the module is disabled (EN = 0 ).",

    "7. Power-Saving Operation Modes\nThe purpose of the Power-Down modes is to reduce power consumption. There are three PowerDown modes:\n\u00b7 Doze mode\n\u00b7 Idle mode\n\u00b7 Sleep mode",
    "7.1 Doze Mode\nDoze mode allows for power-saving by reducing CPU operation and program memory (PFM) access, without affecting peripheral operation. Doze mode differs from Sleep mode because the band gap and system oscillators continue to operate, while only the CPU and PFM are affected. The reduced execution saves power by eliminating unnecessary operations within the CPU and memory.\nWhen the Doze Enable bit is set (DOZEN = 1 ), the CPU executes only one instruction cycle out of every N cycles as defined by the DOZE bits. For example, if DOZE = 001 , the instruction cycle ratio is 1:4. The CPU and memory execute for one instruction cycle and then lay Idle for three instruction cycles. During the unused cycles, the peripherals continue to operate at the system clock speed.",
    "7.1.1 Doze Operation\nThe Doze operation is illustrated in Figure 7-1. For this example:\n\u00b7 Doze enabled (DOZEN = 1 )\n\u00b7 DOZE = 001 (1:4) ratio\n\u00b7 Recover-on-Interrupt enabled (ROI = 1 )\nAs with normal operation, the PFM fetches for the next instruction cycle. The Q-clocks to the peripherals continue throughout.\nFigure 7-1. Doze Mode Operation Example (DOZE[2:0] = 001 , 1:4)",
    "7.1.2 Interrupts During Doze\nIf an interrupt occurs and the Recover-On-Interrupt bit is clear (ROI = 0 ) at the time of the interrupt, the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) continues to execute at the rate selected by DOZE[2:0]. Interrupt latency is extended by the DOZE[2:0] ratio.\nIf an interrupt occurs and the ROI bit is set (ROI = 1 ) at the time of the interrupt, the DOZEN bit is cleared and the CPU executes at full speed. The prefetched instruction is executed and then the interrupt vector sequence is executed. In Figure 7-1, the interrupt occurs during the 2 nd  instruction cycle of the Doze period, and immediately brings the CPU out of Doze. If the Doze-On-Exit (DOE) bit is set (DOE = 1 ) when the RETFIE operation is executed, DOZEN is set, and the CPU executes at the reduced rate based on the DOZE[2:0] ratio.",
    "Example 7-1. Doze Software\n```\n//Mainline operation bool somethingToDo = FALSE: void main () { initializeSystem(); // DOZE = 64:1 (for example) // ROI = 1; GIE = 1; // enable interrupts while (1) { // If ADC completed, process data if (somethingToDo) { doSomething(); DOZEN = 1; // resume low-power } } } // Data interrupt handler void interrupt () { // DOZEN = 0 because ROI = 1 if (ADIF) { somethingToDo = TRUE; DOE = 0; // make main() go fast ADIF = 0; } // else check other interrupts... if (TMR0IF) { timerTick++; DOE = 1; // make main() go slow TMR0IF = 0; } }\n```",
    "7.2 Sleep Mode\nSleep mode is entered by executing the SLEEP instruction, while the Idle Enable (IDLEN) bit of the CPUDOZE register is cleared (IDLEN = 0 ). If the SLEEP instruction is executed while the IDLEN bit is set (IDLEN = 1 ), the CPU will enter the Idle mode.\nUpon entering Sleep mode, the following conditions exist:",
    "7.2 Sleep Mode\n1. Resets other than WDT are not affected by Sleep mode; WDT will be cleared but keeps running if enabled for operation during Sleep.\n2. The PD bit of the STATUS register is cleared.\n3. The TO bit of the STATUS register is set.\n4. The CPU and the System clocks are disabled.\n5. 31 kHz LFINTOSC, HFINTOSC and SOSC will remain enabled if any peripheral has requested them as a clock source or if the HFOEN, LFOEN, or SOSCEN bits of the OSCEN register are set.\n6. ADC is unaffected if the FRC oscillator is selected. When the ADC clock is something other than FRC, a SLEEP instruction causes the present conversion to be aborted and the ADC module is turned off, although the ADON bit remains active.\n7. I/O ports maintain the status they had before SLEEP was executed (driving high, low, or highimpedance) only if no peripheral connected to the I/O port is active.\nRefer to individual chapters for more details on peripheral operation during Sleep.\nTo minimize current consumption, consider the following conditions:\n- \u00b7 I/O pins must not be floating",
    "7.2 Sleep Mode\n\u00b7 External circuitry sinking current from I/O pins\n\u00b7 Internal circuitry sourcing current from I/O pins\n\u00b7 Current draw from pins with internal weak pull-ups\n\u00b7 Modules using any oscillator\nI/O pins that are high-impedance inputs need to be pulled to VDD or VSS externally to avoid switching currents caused by floating inputs.\nExamples of internal circuitry that might be sourcing current include modules such as the DAC and FVR modules.",
    "7.2.1 Wake-up from Sleep\nThe device can wake up from Sleep through one of the following events:\n1. External Reset input on MCLR pin, if enabled.\n2. BOR Reset, if enabled.\n3. Low-Power Brown-Out Reset (LPBOR), if enabled.\n4. POR Reset.\n5. Windowed Watchdog Timer, if enabled.\n6. All interrupt sources except clock switch interrupt can wake up the part.\nThe first five events will cause a device Reset. The last one event is considered a continuation of program execution. To determine whether a device Reset or wake-up event occurred, refer to the ' Determining the Cause of a Reset ' section.",
    "7.2.1 Wake-up from Sleep\nWhen the SLEEP instruction is being executed, the next instruction (PC + 2) is prefetched. For the device to wake up through an interrupt event, the corresponding Interrupt Enable bit must be enabled, as well as the Peripheral Interrupt Enable bit (PEIE = 1 ), for every interrupt not in PIR0. Wake-up will occur regardless of the state of the GIE bit. If the GIE bit is disabled, the device continues execution at the instruction after the SLEEP instruction. If the GIE bit is enabled, the device executes the instruction after the SLEEP instruction, the device will then call the Interrupt Service Routine. In cases where the execution of the instruction following SLEEP is not desirable, the user will have a NOP after the SLEEP instruction.\nThe WDT is cleared when the device wakes up from Sleep, regardless of the source of wake-up.\nUpon a wake from a Sleep event, the core will wait for a combination of three conditions before beginning execution. The conditions are:\n\u00b7 PFM Ready\n\u00b7 COSC-selected Oscillator Ready\n\u00b7 BOR Ready (unless BOR is disabled)",
    "7.2.2 Wake-up Using Interrupts\nWhen global interrupts are disabled (GIE cleared) and any interrupt source, with the exception of the clock switch interrupt, has both its interrupt enable bit and interrupt flag bit set, one of the following will occur:\n\u00b7 If the interrupt occurs before the execution of a SLEEP instruction\n-The SLEEP instruction will execute as a NOP\n-WDT and WDT prescaler will not be cleared\n-The TO bit of the STATUS register will not be set\n-The PD bit of the STATUS register will not be cleared\n\u00b7 If the interrupt occurs during or after the execution of a SLEEP instruction\n-The SLEEP instruction will be completely executed\n-Device will immediately wake up from Sleep\n-WDT and WDT prescaler will be cleared\n-The TO bit of the STATUS register will be set\n-The PD bit of the STATUS register will be cleared\nEven if the flag bits were checked before executing a SLEEP instruction, it may be possible for flag bits to become set before the SLEEP instruction completes. To determine whether a SLEEP instruction executed, test the PD bit. If the PD bit is set, the SLEEP instruction was executed as a NOP .\nFigure 7-2. Wake-up From Sleep Through Interrupt",
    "Notes:\n1. External clock. High, Medium, Low mode assumed.\n2. CLKOUT is shown here for timing reference.\n3. TOST = 1024 TOSC. This delay does not apply to EC and INTOSC Oscillator modes.\n4. GIE = 1 assumed. In this case after wake-up, the processor calls the ISR at 0004h. If GIE = 0 , execution will continue in-line.",
    "7.2.3 Low-Power Sleep Mode\nThe PIC18F65/66K40 device family contains an internal Low Dropout (LDO) voltage regulator, which allows the device I/O pins to operate at voltages up to 5.5V while the internal device logic operates at a lower voltage. The LDO and its associated reference circuitry must remain active when the device is in Sleep mode.\nThe PIC18F65/66K40devices allows the user to optimize the operating current in Sleep, depending on the application requirements.\nLow-Power Sleep mode can be selected by setting the VREGPM bit of the VREGCON register.",
    "7.2.3.1 Sleep Current vs. Wake-up Time\nIn the default operating mode, the LDO and reference circuitry remain in the normal configuration while in Sleep. The device is able to exit Sleep mode quickly since all circuits remain active. In Low-Power Sleep mode, when waking-up from Sleep, an extra delay time is required for these circuits to return to the normal configuration and stabilize.\nThe Low-Power Sleep mode is beneficial for applications that stay in Sleep mode for long periods of time. The Normal mode is beneficial for applications that need to wake from Sleep quickly and frequently.",
    "7.2.3.2 Peripheral Usage in Sleep\nSome peripherals that can operate in Sleep mode will not operate properly with the Low-Power Sleep mode selected. The Low-Power Sleep mode is intended for use with these peripherals:\n\u00b7 Brown-out Reset (BOR)\n\u00b7 Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT)\n\u00b7 External interrupt pin/Interrupt-On-Change pins\n\u00b7 Peripherals that run off external secondary clock source\nIt is the responsibility of the end user to determine what is acceptable for their application when setting the VREGPM settings in order to ensure operation in Sleep.\nImportant: The PIC18F65/66K40 devices do not have a configurable Low-Power Sleep mode. PIC18LF65/66K40 devices are unregulated and are always in the lowest power state when in Sleep, with no wake-up time penalty. These devices have a lower maximum VDD and I/O voltage than the PIC18F65/66K40.",
    "7.2.4 Idle Mode\nWhen IDLEN is set (IDLEN = 1 ), the SLEEP instruction will put the device into Idle mode. In Idle mode, the CPU and memory operations are halted, but the peripheral clocks continue to run. This mode is similar to Doze mode, except that in IDLE both the CPU and PFM are shut off.\nImportant: If CLKOUTEN is enabled (CLKOUTEN = 0 , Configuration Word 1H), the output will continue operating while in Idle.",
    "7.2.4.1 Idle and Interrupts\nIdle mode ends when an interrupt occurs (even if GIE = 0 ), but IDLEN is not changed. The device can re-enter Idle by executing the SLEEP instruction.\nIf Recover-on-Interrupt is enabled (ROI = 1 ), the interrupt that brings the device out of Idle also restores full-speed CPU execution when Doze is also enabled.",
    "7.2.4.2 Idle and WWDT\nWhen in Idle, the WWDT Reset is blocked and will instead wake the device. The WWDT wake-up is not an interrupt, therefore ROI does not apply.\nImportant: The WWDT can bring the device out of Idle, in the same way it brings the device out of Sleep. The DOZEN bit is not affected.",
    "7.3 Peripheral Operation in Power-Saving Modes\nAll selected clock sources and the peripherals running off them are active in both IDLE and DOZE mode. Only in Sleep mode, both the FOSC and FOSC/4 clocks are unavailable. All the other clock sources are active, if enabled manually or through peripheral clock selection before the part enters Sleep.",

See Table 8-1 for BOR active conditions\nNote: See the 'BOR Operating Modes' table for BOR Active conditions.",
    "9.1 Power-on Reset (POR)\nThe POR circuit holds the device in Reset until V DD has reached an acceptable level for minimum operation. Slow rising V DD, fast operating speeds or analog performance may require greater than minimum VDD. The PWRT, BOR or MCLR features can be used to extend the start-up period until all device operation conditions have been met.",
    "9.2 Brown-out Reset (BOR)\nThe BOR circuit holds the device in Reset when VDD reaches a selectable minimum level. Between the POR and BOR, complete voltage range coverage for execution protection can be implemented.\nThe Brown-out Reset module has four operating modes controlled by the BOREN[1:0] bits in CONFIG2. The four operating modes are:\n\u00b7 BOR is always ON\n\u00b7 BOR is OFF when in Sleep\n\u00b7 BOR is controlled by software\n\u00b7 BOR is always OFF\nRefer to BOR Operating Modes for more information.\nThe Brown-out Reset voltage level is selectable by configuring the BORV[1:0] bits in CONFIG2.\nA VDD noise rejection filter prevents the BOR from triggering on small events. If V DD falls below V BOR for a duration greater than parameter TBORDC, the device will reset and the BOR bit in the PCON0 register will be cleared, indicating the Brown-out Reset condition occurred. For more details, see the 'Brown-out Situations' figure in the 'BOR Controlled by Software' section.",

    "9.2.2 BOR Is OFF in Sleep\nWhen the BOREN bits of Configuration Word 2 are programmed to ' 10 ', the BOR is on, except in Sleep. BOR protection is not active during Sleep, but device wake-up will be delayed until the BOR can determine that VDD is higher than the BOR threshold. The device wake-up will be delayed until the BOR is ready.",
    "9.2.3 BOR Controlled by Software\nWhen the BOREN bits of Configuration Words are programmed to ' 01 ', the BOR is controlled by the SBOREN bit. The device start-up is not delayed by the BOR ready condition or the VDD level.\nBOR protection begins as soon as the BOR circuit is ready. The status of the BOR circuit is reflected in the BORRDY bit.\nBOR protection is unchanged by Sleep.\nTable 9-1. BOR Operating Modes",

If V DD falls, the erase cycle will be aborted, but the device will not be reset.",
    "9.3 Low-Power Brown-out Reset (LPBOR)\nThe Low-Power Brown-out Reset (LPBOR) circuit provides alternative protection against Brown-out conditions. When VDD falls below the LPBOR threshold, the device is held in Reset. When this occurs, the BOR bit of the PCON0 register is cleared to indicate that a Brown-out Reset occurred. The BOR bit will be cleared when either the BOR or the LPBOR circuitry detects a BOR condition.\nThe LPBOR feature can be used with or without BOR enabled. When used while BOR is enabled, the LPBOR can be used as a secondary protection circuit in case the BOR circuit fails to detect the BOR condition. Additionally, when BOR is enabled except while in Sleep (BOREN[1:0] = 10 ), the LPBOR circuit will hold the device in Reset while V DD is lower than the LPBOR threshold, and will also re-arm the POR (see Reset, WDT, Oscillator Start-up Timer, Power-up Timer, Brown-out Reset and Low-Power Brown-out Reset Specifications for LPBOR Reset voltage levels).",

The PWRT delay allows additional time for the VDD to rise to an acceptable level. The Power-up Timer is enabled by clearing the PWRTE bit in Configuration Words.\nThe Power-up Timer starts after the release of the POR and BOR.\nFor additional information, refer to Application Note AN607, 'Power-up Trouble Shooting' (DS00000607).",

    "10. WWDT - Windowed Watchdog Timer\nThe Watchdog Timer (WDT) is a system timer that generates a Reset if the firmware does not issue a CLRWDT instruction within the time-out period. The Watchdog Timer is typically used to recover the system from unexpected events. The Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT) differs in that CLRWDT instructions are only accepted when they are performed within a specific window during the time-out period.\nThe WWDT has the following features:\n\u00b7 Selectable Clock Source\n\u00b7 Multiple Operating Modes\n-WWDT is always on\n-WWDT is off when in Sleep\n-WWDT is controlled by software\n-WWDT is always off\n\u00b7 Configurable Time-out Period is from 1 ms to 256s (Nominal)\n\u00b7 Configurable Window Size from 12.5% to 100% of the Time-out Period\n\u00b7 Multiple Reset Conditions\nTitle:\nLast Edit:\nFirst Used:\nWindowed Watchdog Timer Timer Block Diagram\n1/2/2014\nPIC16(L)F1613 (LECQ)\nNotes:\nFigure 10-1.

    "10.1 Independent Clock Source\nThe WWDT can derive its time base from either the 31 kHz LFINTOSC or 31.25 kHz MFINTOSC internal oscillators, depending on the value of the WDTE bits in CONFIG3.\nIf WDTE = 'b1x , then the clock source will be enabled depending on the WDTCCS bits in CONFIG3.\nIf WDTE = 'b01 , the SEN bit in the WDTCON0 register must be set by software to enable WWDT, and the clock source is enabled by the WDTCS bits in the WDTCON1 register.\nTime intervals in this chapter are based on a minimum nominal interval of 1 ms. See Internal Oscillator Parameters for LFINTOSC and MFINTOSC tolerances.",

If any value other than the default value is assigned to WDTCPS Configuration bits, then the timer period will be based on the WDTCPS bits in the CONFIG3 register. After a Reset, the default time-out period is 2s.",
    "Related Links\nCONFIG3",
    "10.4 Watchdog Window\nThe Windowed Watchdog Timer has an optional Windowed mode that is controlled by the WDTCWS bits in Configuration Word 3 and WINDOW bits in the WDTCON1 register. In the Windowed mode, the CLRWDT instruction must occur within the allowed window of the WDT period. Any CLRWDT instruction that occurs outside of this window will trigger a window violation and will cause a WWDT Reset, similar to a WWDT time-out. See Figure 10-2 for an example.\nThe window size is controlled by the Watchdog Timer Window Select (WINDOW) bits in WDTCON1, if WDTCWS bits in Configuration Word 3 are set to 111 .\nThe WDTTMR bits in the WDTTMR register are used to determine whether the window is open, as defined by the WINDOW bits.\nIn the event of a window violation, a Reset will be generated and the WDTWV bit of the PCON0 register will be cleared. This bit is set by a POR or can be set in firmware.",

    "10.5.1 CLRWDT Considerations (Windowed Mode)\nWhen in Windowed mode, the WWDT must be armed before a CLRWDT instruction will clear the timer. This is performed by reading the WDTCON0 register. Executing a CLRWDT instruction without performing such an arming action will trigger a window violation regardless of whether the window is open or not.\nSee Table 10-2 for more information.",
    "10.6 Operation During Sleep\nWhen the device enters Sleep, the WWDT is cleared. If the WWDT is enabled during Sleep, the WWDT resumes counting. When the device exits Sleep, the WWDT is cleared again.\nThe WWDT remains clear until the Oscillator Start-up Timer (OST) completes, if enabled.\nWhen a WWDT time-out occurs while the device is in Sleep, no Reset is generated. Instead, the device wakes up and resumes operation. The TO and PD bits in the STATUS register are changed to indicate the event. The RWDT bit in the PCON0 register can also be used.",

    "11.1.1 Program Counter\nThe Program Counter (PC) specifies the address of the instruction to fetch for execution. The PC is 21 bits wide and is contained in three separate 8-bit registers. The low byte, known as the PCL register, is both readable and writable. The high byte, or PCH register, contains the PC[15:8] bits; it is not directly readable or writable. Updates to the PCH register are performed through the PCLATH register. The upper byte is called PCU. This register contains the PC[20:16] bits; it is also not directly readable or writable. Updates to the PCU register are performed through the PCLATU register.\nThe contents of PCLATH and PCLATU are transferred to the Program Counter by any operation that writes PCL. Similarly, the upper two bytes of the Program Counter are transferred to PCLATH and PCLATU by an operation that reads PCL. This is useful for computed offsets to the PC (see Computed GOTO).",
    "11.1.1 Program Counter\nThe PC addresses bytes in the program memory. To prevent the PC from becoming misaligned with word instructions, the Least Significant bit of PCL is fixed to a value of ' 0 '. The PC increments by two to address sequential instructions in the program memory.\nThe CALL RCALL GOTO , , and program branch instructions write to the Program Counter directly. For these instructions, the contents of PCLATH and PCLATU are not transferred to the Program Counter.",
    "11.1.2 Return Address Stack\nThe return address stack allows any combination of up to 31 program calls and interrupts to occur. The PC is pushed onto the stack when a CALL or RCALL instruction is executed or an interrupt is Acknowledged. The PC value is pulled off the stack on a RETURN RETLW , or a RETFIE instruction. PCLATU and PCLATH are not affected by any of the RETURN or CALL instructions.\nThe stack operates as a 31-word by 21-bit RAM and a 5-bit Stack Pointer, or as a 35-word by 21-bit RAM with a 6-bit Stack Pointer in ICD mode. The stack space is not part of either program or data space. The Stack Pointer is readable and writable and the address on the top of the stack is readable and writable through the Top-of-Stack (TOS) Special File registers. Data can also be pushed to, or popped from the stack, using these registers.",
    "11.1.2 Return Address Stack\nA CALL type instruction causes a push onto the stack; the Stack Pointer is first incremented and the location pointed to by the Stack Pointer is written with the contents of the PC (already pointing to the instruction following the CALL ). A RETURN type instruction causes a pop from the stack; the contents of the location pointed to by the STKPTR are transferred to the PC and then the Stack Pointer is decremented.\nThe Stack Pointer is initialized to '0b00000' after all Resets. There is no RAM associated with the location corresponding to a Stack Pointer value of '0b00000'; this is only a Reset value. Status bits in the PCON0 register indicate if the stack is full or has overflowed or has under-flowed.",
    "11.1.2.1 Top-of-Stack Access\nOnly the top of the return address stack (TOS) is readable and writable. A set of three registers, TOSU:TOSH:TOSL, hold the contents of the stack location pointed to by the STKPTR register (see Figure 11-3). This allows users to implement a software stack if necessary. After a CALL, RCALL or interrupt, the software can read the pushed value by reading the TOSU:TOSH:TOSL registers. These values can be placed on a user defined software stack. At return time, the software can return these values to TOSU:TOSH:TOSL and do a return.\nThe user must disable the Global Interrupt Enable (GIE) bits while accessing the stack to prevent inadvertent stack corruption.",
    "11.1.2.2 Return Stack Pointer\nThe STKPTR register contains the Stack Pointer value. The STKOVF (Stack Overflow) Status bit and the STKUNF (Stack Underflow) Status bit can be accessed using the PCON0 register. The value of the Stack Pointer can be 0 through 31. On Reset, the Stack Pointer value will be zero. The user may read and write the Stack Pointer value. This feature can be used by a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for stack maintenance. After the PC is pushed onto the stack 32 times (without popping any values off the stack), the STKOVF bit is set. The STKOVF bit is cleared by software or by a POR. The action that takes place when the stack becomes full depends on the state of the STVREN (Stack Overflow Reset Enable) Configuration bit.\nIf STVREN is set (default), a Reset will be generated and a Stack Overflow will be indicated by the STKOVF bit when the 32nd push is initiated. This includes CALL and CALLW instructions, as well as stacking the return address during an interrupt response. The STKOVF bit will remain set and the Stack Pointer will be set to zero.",
    "11.1.2.2 Return Stack Pointer\nIf STVREN is cleared, the STKOVF bit will be set on the 32 nd  push and the Stack Pointer will remain at 31 but no Reset will occur. Any additional pushes will overwrite the 31 st  push but the STKPTR will remain at 31.\nSetting STKOVF = 1 in software will change the bit, but will not generate a Reset.\nThe STKUNF bit is set when a stack pop returns a value of zero. The STKUNF bit is cleared by software or by POR. The action that takes place when the stack becomes full depends on the state of the STVREN (Stack Overflow Reset Enable) Configuration bit.\nIf STVREN is set (default) and the stack has been popped enough times to unload the stack, the next pop will return a value of zero to the PC, it will set the STKUNF bit and a Reset will be generated. This condition can be generated by the RETURN RETLW , and RETFIE instructions.\nIf STVREN is cleared, the STKUNF bit will be set, but no Reset will occur.",
    "11.1.2.2 Return Stack Pointer\nImportant: Returning a value of zero to the PC on an underflow has the effect of vectoring the program to the Reset vector, where the stack conditions can be verified and appropriate actions can be taken. This is not the same as a Reset, as the contents of the SFRs are not affected.",
    "Related Links\nCONFIG2",
    "11.1.2.3 Stack Overflow and Underflow Resets\nDevice Resets on Stack Overflow and Stack Underflow conditions are enabled by setting the STVREN Configuration bit in Configuration. When STVREN is set, a Full or Underflow condition will set the\n\uf0e3\nRev. 30-00094A 4/12/2017\nrespective STKOVF or STKUNF bit and then cause a device Reset. When STVREN is cleared, a Full or Underflow condition will set the respective STKOVF or STKUNF bit but not cause a device Reset. The STKOVF or STKUNF bits are cleared by the user software or a Power-on Reset.",
    "11.1.2.4 PUSH and POP Instructions\nSince the Top-of-Stack is readable and writable, the ability to push values onto the stack and pull values off the stack without disturbing normal program execution is a desirable feature. The PIC18 instruction set includes two instructions, PUSH and POP , that permit the TOS to be manipulated under software control. TOSU, TOSH and TOSL can be modified to place data or a return address on the stack.\nThe PUSH instruction places the current PC value onto the stack. This increments the Stack Pointer and loads the current PC value onto the stack.\nThe POP instruction discards the current TOS by decrementing the Stack Pointer. The previous value pushed onto the stack then becomes the TOS value.",
    "11.1.2.5 Fast Register Stack\nA Fast Register Stack is provided for the STATUS, WREG and BSR registers, to provide a 'fast return' option for interrupts. The Stack for each register is only one level deep and is neither readable nor writable. It is loaded with the current value of the corresponding register when the processor vectors for an interrupt. All interrupt sources will push values into the Fast Register Stack. The values in the registers are then loaded back into their associated registers if the RETFIE, FAST instruction is used to return from the interrupt.\nImportant: The TO and PD bits of the STATUS register are not copied over in this operation.\nIf both low and high-priority interrupts are enabled, the Stack registers cannot be used reliably to return from low-priority interrupts. If a high-priority interrupt occurs while servicing a low-priority interrupt, the Stack register values stored by the low-priority interrupt will be overwritten. In these cases, users must save the key registers by software during a low-priority interrupt.",
    "11.1.2.5 Fast Register Stack\nIf interrupt priority is not used, all interrupts may use the Fast Register Stack for returns from interrupt. If no interrupts are used, the Fast Register Stack can be used to restore the STATUS, WREG and BSR registers at the end of a subroutine call. To use the Fast Register Stack for a subroutine call, a CALL label , FAST instruction must be executed to save the STATUS , WREG and BSR registers to the Fast Register Stack. A RETURN, FAST instruction is then executed to restore these registers from the Fast Register Stack.\nThe following example shows a source code example that uses the Fast Register Stack during a subroutine call and return.",

    "11.1.3.1 Computed GOTO\nA computed GOTO is accomplished by adding an offset to the Program Counter. An example is shown in the following code example.\nA Look-up Table can be formed with an ADDWF PCL instruction and a group of RETLW nn instructions. The W register is loaded with an offset into the table before executing a call to that table. The first instruction of the called routine is the ADDWF PCL instruction. The next instruction executed will be one of the RETLW nn instructions that returns the value ' nn ' to the calling function.\nThe offset value (in WREG) specifies the number of bytes that the Program Counter must advance and must be multiples of two (LSb = 0 ).\nIn this method, only one data byte may be stored in each instruction location and room on the return address stack is required.",

Data is transferred to or from program memory one byte at a time.",
    "11.2.1 Clocking Scheme\nThe microcontroller clock input, whether from an internal or external source, is internally divided by four to generate four nonoverlapping quadrature clocks (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4). Internally, the Program Counter is incremented on every Q1; the instruction is fetched from the program memory and latched onto the instruction register during Q4. The instruction is decoded and executed during the following Q1 through Q4. The clocks and instruction execution flow are shown in the following figure.",
    "11.2.2 Instruction Flow/Pipelining\nAn 'Instruction Cycle' consists of four Q cycles: Q1 through Q4. The instruction fetch and execute are pipelined in such a manner that a fetch takes one instruction cycle, while the decode and execute take another instruction cycle. However, due to the pipelining, each instruction effectively executes in one cycle. If an instruction causes the Program Counter to change (e.g., GOTO ), then two cycles are required to complete the instruction as shown in the figure below.\nA fetch cycle begins with the Program Counter (PC) incrementing in Q1.\nIn the execution cycle, the fetched instruction is latched onto the Instruction Register (IR) in cycle Q1. This instruction is then decoded and executed during the Q2, Q3 and Q4 cycles. Data memory is read during Q2 (operand read) and written during Q4 (destination write).\nFigure 11-5. Instruction Pipeline Flow\n\uf0e3\nAll instructions are single cycle except for any program branches. These take two cycles since the fetch instruction is 'flushed' from the pipeline while the new instruction is being fetched and then executed.",
    "11.2.3 Instructions in Program Memory\nThe program memory is addressed in bytes. Instructions are stored as either two bytes or four bytes in program memory. The Least Significant Byte of an instruction word is always stored in a program memory location with an even address (LSb = 0 ). To maintain alignment with instruction boundaries, the PC increments in steps of two and the LSb will always read ' 0 ' (see Program Counter).\nThe Instructions in Program Memory figure below shows how instruction words are stored in the program memory.\nThe CALL and GOTO instructions have the absolute program memory address embedded into the instruction. Since instructions are always stored on word boundaries, the data contained in\nthe instruction is a word address. The word address is written to PC[20:1], which accesses the desired byte address in program memory. Instruction #2 in the example shows how the instruction GOTO 0006h is encoded in the program memory. Program branch instructions, which encode a relative address offset, operate in the same manner. The offset value stored in a branch instruction represents the number of single-word instructions that the PC will be offset by.

If the instruction is executed in proper sequence - immediately after the first word - the data in the second word is accessed and used by the instruction sequence. If the first word is skipped for some reason and the second word is executed by itself, a NOP is executed instead. This is necessary for cases when the two-word instruction is preceded by a conditional instruction that changes the PC.

    "\uf0e3 11.3 Data Memory Organization\nImportant: The operation of some aspects of data memory are changed when the PIC18 extended instruction set is enabled. See PIC18 Instruction Execution and the Extended Instruction Set for more information.\nThe data memory in PIC18 devices is implemented as static RAM. Each register in the data memory has a 12-bit address, allowing up to 4096 bytes of data memory. The memory space is divided into as many as 16 banks that contain 256 bytes each. The figure below shows the data memory organization for all devices in the device family.\nThe data memory contains Special Function Registers (SFRs) and General Purpose Registers (GPRs). The SFRs are used for control and status of the controller and peripheral functions, while GPRs are used for data storage and scratchpad operations in the user's application. Any read of an unimplemented location will read as ' 0 's.\nThe instruction set and architecture allow operations across all banks. The entire data memory may be accessed by Direct, Indirect or Indexed Addressing modes. Addressing modes are discussed later in this subsection.",
    "\uf0e3 11.3 Data Memory Organization\nTo ensure that commonly used registers (SFRs and select GPRs) can be accessed in a single cycle, PIC18 devices implement an Access Bank. This is a 256-byte memory space that provides fast access to SFRs and the lower portion of GPR Bank 0 without using the Bank Select Register (BSR). The Access Bank section provides a detailed description of the Access RAM.\nFigure 11-8. Data Memory Map",
    "11.3.1 Bank Select Register\nLarge areas of data memory require an efficient addressing scheme to make rapid access to any address possible. Ideally, this means that an entire address does not need to be provided for each read or write operation. For PIC18 devices, this is accomplished with a RAM banking scheme. This divides the memory space into 16 contiguous banks of 256 bytes. Depending on the instruction, each location can be addressed directly by its full 12-bit address, or an 8-bit low-order address and a 4-bit Bank Pointer.\nMost instructions in the PIC18 instruction set make use of the Bank Pointer, known as the Bank Select Register (BSR). This SFR holds the four Most Significant bits of a location's address; the instruction itself includes the eight Least Significant bits. Only the four lower bits of the BSR are implemented (BSR[3:0]). The upper four bits are unused; they will always read ' 0 ' and cannot be written to. The BSR can be loaded directly by using the MOVLB instruction.",
    "11.3.1 Bank Select Register\nThe value of the BSR indicates the bank in data memory; the eight bits in the instruction show the location in the bank and can be thought of as an offset from the bank's lower boundary. The relationship between the BSR's value and the bank division in data memory is shown in the figure below.\nSince up to 16 registers may share the same low-order address, the user must always be careful to ensure that the proper bank is selected before performing a data read or write. For example, writing what should be program data to an 8-bit address of F9h while the BSR is 0Fh will end up resetting the Program Counter.\nWhile any bank can be selected, only those banks that are actually implemented can be read or written to. Writes to unimplemented banks are ignored, while reads from unimplemented banks will return '0's. Even so, the STATUS register will still be affected as if the operation was successful. The data memory maps in the following figure indicate which banks are implemented.",
    "11.3.1 Bank Select Register\nIn the core PIC18 instruction set, only the MOVFF instruction fully specifies the 12-bit address of the source and target registers. This instruction ignores the BSR completely when it executes. All other instructions include only the low-order address as an operand and must use either the BSR or the Access Bank to locate their target registers.\nFigure 11-9. Use of the Bank Select Register (Direct Addressing)\nThe Access RAM bit of the instruction can be used to force an override of the selected bank (BSR  [3:0]) to the registers of the Access Bank. Notes  1:\n2: The MOVFF instruction embeds the entire 12-bit address in the instruction.",
    "11.3.2 Access Bank\nWhile the use of the BSR with an embedded 8-bit address allows users to address the entire range of data memory, it also means that the user must always ensure that the correct bank is selected. Otherwise, data may be read from or written to the wrong location. This can be disastrous if a GPR is the intended target of an operation, but an SFR is written to instead. Verifying and/or changing the BSR for each read or write to data memory can become very inefficient.",
    "11.3.2 Access Bank\nTo streamline access for the most commonly used data memory locations, the data memory is configured with an Access Bank, which allows users to access a mapped block of memory without specifying a BSR. The Access Bank consists of the first 96 bytes of memory (00h-5Fh) in Bank 0 and the last 160 bytes of memory (60h-FFh) in Block 15. The lower half is known as the 'Access RAM' and is composed of GPRs. This upper half is also where the device's SFRs are mapped. These two areas are mapped contiguously in the Access Bank and can be addressed in a linear fashion by an 8-bit address (see Data Memory Map).\nThe Access Bank is used by core PIC18 instructions that include the Access RAM bit (the 'a' parameter in the instruction). When 'a' is equal to ' 1 ', the instruction uses the BSR and the 8-bit address included in the opcode for the data memory address. When 'a' is ' 0 ', however, the instruction is forced to use the Access Bank address map; the current value of the BSR is ignored entirely.",
    "11.3.2 Access Bank\nUsing this 'forced' addressing allows the instruction to operate on a data address in a single cycle, without updating the BSR first. For 8-bit addresses of 60h and above, this means that users can evaluate and operate on SFRs more efficiently. The Access RAM below 60h is a good place for data values that the user might need to access rapidly, such as immediate computational results or common program variables. Access RAM also allows for faster and more code efficient context saving and switching of variables.\n\uf0e3\nThe mapping of the Access Bank is slightly different when the extended instruction set is enabled (XINST Configuration bit = 1 ). This is discussed in more detail in the Mapping the Access Bank in Indexed Literal Offset Mode section.",
    "11.3.3 General Purpose Register File\nPIC18 devices may have banked memory in the GPR area. This is data RAM, which is available for use by all instructions. GPRs start at the bottom of Bank 0 (address 000h) and grow upwards towards the bottom of the SFR area. GPRs are not initialized by a Power-on Reset and are unchanged on all other Resets.",
    "11.3.4 Special Function Registers\nThe Special Function Registers (SFRs) are registers used by the CPU and peripheral modules for controlling the desired operation of the device. These registers are implemented as static RAM. SFRs start at the top of data memory (FFFh) and extend downward. A list of these registers is given in the register summary table.\nThe SFRs can be classified into two sets: those associated with the 'core' device functionality (ALU, Resets and interrupts) and those related to the peripheral functions. The Reset and Interrupt registers are described in their respective chapters, while the ALU's STATUS register is described later in this section. Registers related to the operation of a peripheral feature are described in the chapter for that peripheral.\nThe SFRs are typically distributed among the peripherals whose functions they control. Unused SFR locations are unimplemented and read as ' 0 's.",
    "Related Links\nRegister Summary",
    "11.3.5 Status Register\nThe STATUS register contains the arithmetic status of the ALU. As with any other SFR, it can be the operand for any instruction.\nIf the STATUS register is the destination for an instruction that affects the Z, DC, C, OV or N bits, the results of the instruction are not written; instead, the STATUS register is updated according to the instruction performed. Therefore, the result of an instruction with the STATUS register as its destination may be different than intended. As an example, CLRF STATUS will set the Z bit and leave the remaining Status bits unchanged (' 000u u1uu ').\nIt is recommended that only BCF BSF SWAPF MOVFF , , , and MOVWF instructions are used to alter the STATUS register, because these instructions do not affect the Z, C, DC, OV or N bits in the STATUS register.\nFor other instructions that do not affect Status bits, see the instruction set summaries.\nImportant: The C and DC bits operate as the Borrow and Digit Borrow bits, respectively, in subtraction.",

    "11.4 Data Addressing Modes\nImportant: The execution of some instructions in the core PIC18 instruction set are changed when the PIC18 extended instruction set is enabled. See Data Memory and the Extended Instruction Set for more information.\nInformation in the data memory space can be addressed in several ways. For most instructions, the Addressing mode is fixed. Other instructions may use up to three modes, depending on which operands are used and whether or not the extended instruction set is enabled.\nThe Addressing modes are:\n\u00b7 Inherent\n\u00b7 Literal\n\u00b7 Direct\n\u00b7 Indirect\nAn additional Addressing mode, Indexed Literal Offset, is available when the extended instruction set is enabled (XINST Configuration bit = 1 ). Its operation is discussed in greater detail in Indexed Addressing with Literal Offset.",
    "11.4.1 Inherent and Literal Addressing\nMany PIC18 control instructions do not need any argument at all; they either perform an operation that globally affects the device or they operate implicitly on one register. This Addressing mode is known as Inherent Addressing. Examples include SLEEP RESET , and DAW .\nOther instructions work in a similar way but require an additional explicit argument in the opcode. This is known as Literal Addressing mode because they require some literal value as an argument. Examples include ADDLW and MOVLW , which respectively, add or move a literal value to the W register. Other examples include CALL and GOTO , which include a 20-bit program memory address.",
    "11.4.2 Direct Addressing\nDirect Addressing specifies all or part of the source and/or destination address of the operation within the opcode itself. The options are specified by the arguments accompanying the instruction.\nIn the core PIC18 instruction set, bit-oriented and byte-oriented instructions use some version of Direct Addressing by default. All of these instructions include some 8-bit literal address as their Least Significant Byte. This address specifies either a register address in one of the banks of data RAM (see General Purpose Register File) or a location in the Access Bank (see Access Bank) as the data source for the instruction.\nThe Access RAM bit 'a' determines how the address is interpreted. When 'a' is ' 1 ', the contents of the BSR (see Bank Select Register) are used with the address to determine the complete 12-bit address of the register. When 'a' is ' 0 ', the address is interpreted as being a register in the Access Bank. Addressing that uses the Access RAM is sometimes also known as Direct Forced Addressing mode.\nA few instructions, such as MOVFF , include the entire 12-bit address (either source or destination) in their opcodes. In these cases, the BSR is ignored entirely.",
    "11.4.2 Direct Addressing\nThe destination of the operation's results is determined by the destination bit 'd'. When 'd' is ' 1 ', the results are stored back in the source register, overwriting its original contents. When 'd' is ' 0 ', the results are stored in the W register. Instructions without the 'd' argument have a destination that is implicit in the instruction; their destination is either the target register being operated on or the W register.",
    "11.4.3 Indirect Addressing\nIndirect Addressing allows the user to access a location in data memory without giving a fixed address in the instruction. This is done by using File Select Registers (FSRs) as pointers to the locations which are to be read or written. Since the FSRs are themselves located in RAM as Special File Registers, they can also be directly manipulated under program control. This makes FSRs very useful in implementing data structures, such as tables and arrays in data memory.\nThe registers for Indirect Addressing are also implemented with Indirect File Operands (INDFs) that permit automatic manipulation of the pointer value with auto-incrementing, auto-decrementing or offsetting with another value. This allows for efficient code, using loops, such as the following example of clearing an entire RAM bank.",
    "11.4.3.1 FSR Registers and the INDF Operand\nAt the core of Indirect Addressing are three sets of registers: FSR0, FSR1 and FSR2. Each represents a pair of 8-bit registers, FSRnH and FSRnL. Each FSR pair holds a 12-bit value, therefore, the four upper bits of the FSRnH register are not used. The 12-bit FSR value can address the entire range of the data memory in a linear fashion. The FSR register pairs, then, serve as pointers to data memory locations.",
    "11.4.3.1 FSR Registers and the INDF Operand\nIndirect Addressing is accomplished with a set of Indirect File Operands, INDF0 through INDF2. These can be thought of as 'virtual' registers; they are mapped in the SFR space but are not physically implemented. Reading or writing to a particular INDF register actually accesses its corresponding FSR register pair. A read from INDF1, for example, reads the data at the address indicated by FSR1H:FSR1L. Instructions that use the INDF registers as operands actually use the contents of their corresponding FSR as a pointer to the instruction's target. The INDF operand is just a convenient way of using the pointer.\nBecause Indirect Addressing uses a full 12-bit address, the FSR value can target any location in any bank regardless of the BSR value. However, the Access RAM bit must be cleared to 0 to ensure that the INDF register in Access space is the object of the operation instead of a register in one of the other banks. The assembler default value for the Access RAM bit is zero when targeting any of the indirect operands.",
    "11.4.3.2 FSR Registers and POSTINC, POSTDEC, PREINC and PLUSW\nIn addition to the INDF operand, each FSR register pair also has four additional indirect operands. Like INDF, these are 'virtual' registers that cannot be directly read or written. Accessing these registers actually accesses the location to which the associated FSR register pair points, and also performs a specific action on the FSR value. They are:\n\u00b7 POSTDEC: accesses the location to which the FSR points, then automatically decrements the FSR by 1 afterwards\n\u00b7 POSTINC: accesses the location to which the FSR points, then automatically increments the FSR by 1 afterwards\n\u00b7 PREINC: automatically increments the FSR by one, then uses the location to which the FSR points in the operation\n\u00b7 PLUSW: adds the signed value of the W register (range of -127 to 128) to that of the FSR and uses the location to which the result points in the operation",
    "11.4.3.2 FSR Registers and POSTINC, POSTDEC, PREINC and PLUSW\nIn this context, accessing an INDF register uses the value in the associated FSR register without changing it. Similarly, accessing a PLUSW register gives the FSR value an offset by that in the W register; however, neither W nor the FSR is actually changed in the operation. Accessing the other virtual registers changes the value of the FSR register.\nFigure 11-10. Indirect Addressing\nOperations on the FSRs with POSTDEC, POSTINC and PREINC affect the entire register pair; that is, rollovers of the FSRnL register from FFh to 00h carry over to the FSRnH register. On the other hand, results of these operations do not change the value of any flags in the STATUS register (e.g., Z, N, OV, etc.).",
    "11.4.3.2 FSR Registers and POSTINC, POSTDEC, PREINC and PLUSW\nThe PLUSW register can be used to implement a form of Indexed Addressing in the data memory space. By manipulating the value in the W register, users can reach addresses that are fixed offsets from pointer addresses. In some applications, this can be used to implement some powerful program control structure, such as software stacks, inside of data memory.",
    "11.4.3.3 Operations by FSRs on FSRs\nIndirect Addressing operations that target other FSRs or virtual registers represent special cases. For example, using an FSR to point to one of the virtual registers will not result in successful operations. As a specific case, assume that FSR0H:FSR0L contains the address of INDF1. Attempts to read the value of the INDF1 using INDF0 as an operand will return 00h. Attempts to write to INDF1 using INDF0 as the operand will result in a NOP .\nOn the other hand, using the virtual registers to write to an FSR pair may not occur as planned. In these cases, the value will be written to the FSR pair but without any incrementing or decrementing. Thus, writing to either the INDF2 or POSTDEC2 register will write the same value to the FSR2H:FSR2L.\nSince the FSRs are physical registers mapped in the SFR space, they can be manipulated through all direct operations. The users must proceed cautiously when working on these registers, particularly if their code uses Indirect Addressing.",
    "11.4.3.3 Operations by FSRs on FSRs\nSimilarly, operations by Indirect Addressing are permitted on all other SFRs. The users must exercise the appropriate caution that they do not inadvertently change settings that might affect the operation of the device.",
    "11.5 Data Memory and the Extended Instruction Set\nEnabling the PIC18 extended instruction set (XINST Configuration bit = 1 ) significantly changes certain aspects of data memory and its addressing. Specifically, the use of the Access Bank for many of the core PIC18 instructions is different; this is due to the introduction of a new Addressing mode for the data memory space.\nWhat does not change is just as important. The size of the data memory space is unchanged, as well as its linear addressing. The SFR map remains the same. Core PIC18 instructions can still operate in both Direct and Indirect Addressing mode; inherent and literal instructions do not change at all. Indirect addressing with FSR0 and FSR1 also remain unchanged.",
    "11.5.1 Indexed Addressing with Literal Offset\nEnabling the PIC18 extended instruction set changes the behavior of Indirect Addressing using the FSR2 register pair within Access RAM. Under the proper conditions, instructions that use the Access Bank - that is, most bit-oriented and byte-oriented instructions - can invoke a form of Indexed Addressing using an offset specified in the instruction. This special Addressing mode is known as Indexed Addressing with Literal Offset, or Indexed Literal Offset mode.\nWhen using the extended instruction set, this Addressing mode requires the following:\n\u00b7 The use of the Access Bank is forced ('a' = 0 ) and\n\u00b7 The file address argument is less than or equal to 5Fh\nUnder these conditions, the file address of the instruction is not interpreted as the lower byte of an address (used with the BSR in Direct Addressing), or as an 8-bit address in the Access Bank. Instead, the value is interpreted as an offset value to an Address Pointer, specified by FSR2. The offset and the contents of FSR2 are added to obtain the target address of the operation.",
    "11.5.2 Instructions Affected by Indexed Literal Offset Mode\nAny of the core PIC18 instructions that can use Direct Addressing are potentially affected by the Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode. This includes all byte-oriented and bit-oriented instructions, or almost one-half of the standard PIC18 instruction set. Instructions that only use Inherent or Literal Addressing modes are unaffected.\nAdditionally, byte-oriented and bit-oriented instructions are not affected if they do not use the Access Bank (Access RAM bit is ' 1 '), or include a file address of 60h or above. Instructions meeting these criteria will continue to execute as before. A comparison of the different possible Addressing modes when the extended instruction set is enabled is shown in the following figure.\nThose who desire to use byte-oriented or bit-oriented instructions in the Indexed Literal Offset mode must note the changes to assembler syntax for this mode. This is described in more detail in the 'Extended Instruction Syntax' section.",

    "11.5.3 Mapping the Access Bank in Indexed Literal Offset Mode\nThe use of Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode effectively changes how the first 96 locations of Access RAM (00h to 5Fh) are mapped. Rather than containing just the contents of the bottom section of Bank 0, this mode maps the contents from a user defined 'window' that can be located anywhere in the data memory space. The value of FSR2 establishes the lower boundary of the addresses mapped into the window, while the upper boundary is defined by FSR2 plus 95 (5Fh). Addresses in the Access RAM above 5Fh are mapped as previously described (see Access Bank). An example of Access Bank remapping in this Addressing mode is shown in the following figure.\nFigure 11-12. Remapping the Access Bank with Indexed Literal Offset Addressing",
    "Example Situation:\nADDWF f, d, a FSR2H:FSR2L = 120h\nLocations in the region from the FSR2 pointer (120h)  to  the  pointer  plus 05Fh  (17Fh)  are  mapped to the bottom of the Access RAM (000h-05Fh).\nSpecial  File  Registers  at F60h  through  FFFh  are mapped  to  60h  through FFh, as usual.\nBank  0  addresses  below 5Fh can still be addressed by using the BSR.\nRev. 30-000111A\n4/18/2017\nRemapping of the Access Bank applies only to operations using the Indexed Literal Offset mode. Operations that use the BSR (Access RAM bit is ' 1 ') will continue to use Direct Addressing as before.",

Then, the new data and retained data can be written into the write latches to reprogram the row of PFM. However, any unprogrammed locations can be written without first erasing the row.

    "12.1.1.5 Table Pointer Boundaries\nTBLPTR is used in reads, writes and erases of the Program Flash Memory.\nWhen a TBLRD is executed, all 22 bits of the TBLPTR determine which byte is read from program memory directly into the TABLAT register.\nWhen a TBLWT is executed the byte in the TABLAT register is written, not to Flash memory but, to a holding register in preparation for a program memory write. The holding registers constitute a write block which varies depending on the device (see the Flash Memory Organization by Device table).The LSbs of the TBLPTRL register determine which specific address within the holding register block is written to. The size of the write block determines the number of LSbs. The MSbs of the Table Pointer have no effect during TBLWT operations.\nWhen a program memory write is executed the entire holding register block is written to the Flash memory at the address determined by the MSbs of the TBLPTR. The LSbs are ignored during Flash memory writes. For more details, see the \"Writing to Program Flash Memory\" section.\nThe Figure 12-3 figure illustrates the relevant boundaries of TBLPTR based on NVM control operations.",

    "12.1.3 Erasing Program Flash Memory\nThe minimum erase block varies by device as shown in the memory organization table. Only through the use of an external programmer, or through ICSP \u2122 control, can larger blocks of program memory be bulk erased. Word erase in the Flash array is not supported.\nFor example, when initiating an erase sequence from a microcontroller with erase row size of 32 words, a block of 32 words (64 bytes) of program memory is erased. The TBLPTR<21:6> bits point to the block being erased. The TBLPTR<5:0> bits are ignored.\nThe NVMCON1 register commands the erase operation. The NVMREG bits must be set to point to the Program Flash Memory. The WREN bit must be set to enable write operations. The FREE bit is set to select an erase operation.\nThe NVM unlock sequence described in the NVM Unlock Sequence section must be used which guards against accidental writes. This is sometimes referred to as a long write.\nA long write is necessary for erasing the internal Flash. Instruction execution is halted during the long write cycle.

There are only as many holding registers as there are bytes in a write block.\nSince the table latch (TABLAT) is only a single byte, the TBLWT instruction needs to be executed multiple times for each programming operation. The write protection state is ignored for this operation. All of the table write operations will essentially be short writes because only the holding registers are written. NVMIF is not affected while writing to the holding registers.\nAfter all the holding registers have been written, the programming operation of that block of memory is started by configuring the NVMCON1 register for a program memory write and performing the long write sequence.\nIf the PFM address in the TBLPTR is write-protected or if TBLPTR points to an invalid location, the WR bit is cleared without any effect and the WRERR is signaled.",

WREN is not changed.\nThe internal programming timer controls the write time. The write/erase voltages are generated by an on-chip charge pump, rated to operate over the voltage range of the device.\nImportant: The default value of the holding registers on device Resets and after write operations is FFh. A value of FFh in a holding register will not change the PFM location corresponding to that register when the block is programmed. This means that individual bytes of program memory may be modified, provided that the change does not attempt to change any bit from a ' 0 ' to a ' 1 '.

The EEPROM is readable and writable during normal operation over the entire VDD range.\nFour SFRs are used to read and write to the data EEPROM.

It is used exclusively in the memory write and erase unlock sequences. Reading NVMCON2 will read all ' 0 's.\nThe NVMCON1 register is the control register for data and program memory access. Control bits NVMREG determine if the access will be to program, Data EEPROM Memory or the User IDs, Configuration bits, Revision ID and Device ID.\nThe WREN bit, when set, will allow a write operation. On power-up, the WREN bit is clear.\nControl bits, RD and WR, start read and erase/write operations, respectively.

The multiplier performs an unsigned operation and yields a 16-bit result that is stored in the product register pair, PRODH:PRODL. The multiplier's operation does not affect any flags in the STATUS register.\nMaking multiplication a hardware operation allows it to be completed in a single instruction cycle. This has the advantages of higher computational throughput and reduced code size for multiplication algorithms and allows the PIC18 devices to be used in many applications previously reserved for digital signal processors. A comparison of various hardware and software multiply operations, along with the savings in memory and execution time, is shown in Table 13-1.",
    "13.2 Operation\nExample 13-1 shows the instruction sequence for an 8x8 unsigned multiplication. Only one instruction is required when one of the arguments is already loaded in the WREG register.\nExample 13-2 shows the sequence to do an 8x8 signed multiplication. To account for the sign bits of the arguments, each argument's Most Significant bit (MSb) is tested and the appropriate subtractions are done.\n```\nExample 13-1. 8x8 Unsigned Multiply Routine MOVF    ARG1, W   ; MULWF   ARG2      ; ARG1 * ARG2 -> PRODH:PRODL\n```\n\nExample 13-2. 8x8 Signed Multiply Routine\nMOVF    ARG1, W\nBTFSC   ARG2, SB   ; Test Sign Bit\nMULWF   ARG2       ; ARG1 * ARG2 -> PRODH:PRODL\nSUBWF   PRODH, F   ; PRODH = PRODH - ARG1\nBTFSC   ARG1, SB   ; Test Sign Bit\nMOVF    ARG2, W\nSUBWF   PRODH, F   ; PRODH = PRODH - ARG2\n\nTable 13-1.

The LSb of any CRC polynomial is always ' 1 ' and will always be treated as a ' 1 ' by the CRC for calculating the CRC check value. This bit will be read in software as a ' 0 '.",
    "14.3 CRC Polynomial Implementation\nAny polynomial can be used. The polynomial and accumulator sizes are determined by the PLEN bits. For an n-bit accumulator, PLEN = n-1 and the corresponding polynomial is n+1 bits. Therefore, the accumulator can be any size up to 16 bits with a corresponding polynomial up to 17 bits. The MSb and LSb of the polynomial are always ' 1 ' which is forced by hardware. However, the LSb of the CRCXORL register is unimplemented and always reads as ' 0 '.\nAll polynomial bits between the MSb and LSb are specified by the CRCXOR registers. For example, when using CRC16-ANSI, the polynomial is defined as X 16 +X 15 +X 2 +1. The X 16  and X 0  = 1 terms are the MSb and LSb controlled by hardware. The X 15  and X 2  terms are specified by setting the corresponding CRCXOR[15:0] bits with the value of 0x8004. The actual value is 0x8005 because the hardware sets the LSb to 1 .

Only the number of data bits in the CRCDATA registers specified by DLEN will be used, other data bits in CRCDATA registers will be ignored.\nData is moved into the CRCSHIFT as an intermediate to calculate the check value located in the CRCACC registers.\nThe SHIFTM bit is used to determine the bit order of the data being shifted into the accumulator. If SHIFTM is not set, the data will be shifted in MSb first (Big Endian). The value of DLEN will determine the MSb. If SHIFTM bit is set, the data will be shifted into the accumulator in reversed order, LSb first (Little Endian).\nThe CRC module can be seeded with an initial value by setting the CRCACC registers to the appropriate value before beginning the CRC.",
    "14.4.1 CRC from User Data\nTo use the CRC module on data input from the user, the user must write the data to the CRCDAT registers. The data from the CRCDAT registers will be latched onto the shift registers on any write to the CRCDATL register.",
    "14.4.2 CRC from Flash\nTo use the CRC module on data located in Flash memory, the user can initialize the program memory scanner as defined in the Program Memory Scan Configuration section.",
    "14.5 CRC Check Value\nThe CRC check value will be located in the CRCACC registers after the CRC calculation has finished. The check value will depend on the ACCM and SHIFTM mode settings.\nWhen the ACCM bit is set, the CRC module augments the data with a number of zeros equal to the length of the polynomial to align the final check value. When the ACCM bit is not set, the CRC will stop at the end of the data. A number of zeros equal to the length of the polynomial can then be entered into CRCDAT to find the same check value as augmented mode. Alternatively, the expected check value can be entered at this point to make the final result equal 0.",
    "14.5 CRC Check Value\nWhen the CRC check value is computed with the SHIFTM bit set, selecting LSb first, and the ACCM bit is set then the final value in the CRCACC registers will be reversed such that the LSb will be in the MSb position and vice versa. This is the expected check value in bit reversed form. When creating a check value to be appended to a data stream, then a bit reversal must be performed on the final value to achieve the correct checksum. CRC can be used to do this reversal by following the steps below:\n1. Save CRCACC value in user RAM space.\n2. Clear the CRCACC registers.\n3. Clear the CRCXOR registers.\n4. Write the saved CRCACC value to the CRCDAT input.\nThe properly oriented check value will be in the CRCACC registers as the result.",
    "14.6 CRC Interrupt\nThe CRC will generate an interrupt when the BUSY bit transitions from 1 to 0 . The CRCIF Interrupt Flag bit of the PIRx register is set every time the BUSY bit transitions, regardless of whether or not the CRC interrupt is enabled. The CRCIF bit can only be cleared in software. The CRC interrupt enable is the CRCIE bit of the PIEx register.",
    "14.7 Configuring the CRC\nThe following steps illustrate how to properly configure the CRC.\n1. Determine if the automatic program memory scan will be used with the scanner or manual calculation through the SFR interface and perform the actions specified in CRC Data Sources, depending on which decision was made.\n2. If desired, seed a starting CRC value into the CRCACC registers.\n3. Program the CRCXOR registers with the desired generator polynomial.\n4. Program the DLEN bits with the length of the data word - 1 (refer to Figure 14-1). This determines how many times the shifter will shift into the accumulator for each data word.\n5. Program the PLEN bits with the length of the polynomial -2 (refer to Figure 14-1).\n6. Determine whether shifting in trailing zeros is desired and set the ACCM bit accordingly.\n7. Likewise, determine whether the MSb or LSb must be shifted first and write the SHIFTM bit accordingly.\n8. Set the GO bit to begin the shifting process.",
    "14.7 Configuring the CRC\n9. If manual SFR entry is used, monitor the FULL bit. When FULL = 0 , another word of data can be written to the CRCDAT registers, keeping in mind that the Most Significant Byte, CRCDATH, must be written first if the data has more than eight bits, as the shifter will begin upon the CRCDATL register being written.\n10. If the scanner is used, the scanner will automatically stuff words into the CRCDAT registers as needed, as long as the SCANGO bit is set.\n11. If using the Flash memory scanner, monitor the PIRx SCANIF bit (or the SCANGO bit) for the scanner to finish pushing information into the CRCDATA registers. After the scanner is completed, monitor the BUSY bit to determine that the CRC has been completed and the check value can be read from the CRCACC registers. If both the interrupt flags are set (or both BUSY and SCANGO bits are cleared), the completed CRC calculation can be read from the CRCACC registers.\n12. If manual entry is used, monitor the BUSY bit to determine when the CRCACC registers hold the valid check value.",
    "14.8 Program Memory Scan Configuration\nThe program memory scan module may be used in conjunction with the CRC module to perform a CRC calculation over a range of program memory addresses. To set up the scanner to work with the CRC the following steps need to performed:\n1. Set both the EN and SCANEN bits. If they get disabled, all internal states of the scanner and the CRC are reset. However, the CRC SFR registers are unaffected.\n2. Choose which memory access mode is to be used (see Scanning Modes) and set the MODE bits accordingly.\n3. Based on the memory access mode, set the INTM bits to the appropriate Interrupt mode (see Interrupt Interaction).\n4. Set the SCANLADR and SCANHADR registers with the respective beginning and ending locations in memory that are to be scanned.",
    "14.8 Program Memory Scan Configuration\n5. The GO bit must be set before setting the SCANGO bit. Setting the SCANGO bit starts the scan. Both the EN and GO bits must be enabled to use the scanner. When either of these bits are disabled, the scan aborts and the INVALID bit is set. The scanner will wait for the signal from the CRC that it is ready for the first Flash memory location, then begin loading data into the CRC. It will continue to do so until it either hits the configured end address or an address that is unimplemented on the device, at which point the SCANGO bit will clear, Scanner functions will cease, and the SCANIF interrupt will be triggered. Alternately, the SCANGO bit can be cleared in software to terminate the scan early if desired.",
    "14.9 Scanner Interrupt\nThe scanner will trigger an interrupt when the SCANGO bit transitions from ' 1 ' to ' 0 '. The SCANIF interrupt flag of PIRx is set when the last memory location is reached and the data is entered into the CRCDATA registers. The SCANIF bit can only be cleared in software. The SCAN interrupt enable is the SCANIE bit of the PIEx register.",
    "14.10 Scanning Modes\nThe memory scanner can scan in four modes: Burst, Peek, Concurrent, and Triggered. These modes are controlled by the MODE bits. The four modes are summarized in Table 14-1.",
    "14.10.1  Burst Mode\nWhen MODE = 01 , the scanner is in Burst mode. In Burst mode, CPU operation is stalled beginning with the operation after the one that sets the SCANGO bit, and the scan begins, using the instruction clock to execute. The CPU is held in its current state until the scan stops. Note that because the CPU is not executing instructions, the SCANGO bit cannot be cleared in software, so the CPU will remain stalled until one of the hardware end-conditions occurs. Burst mode has the highest throughput for the scanner, but has the cost of stalling other execution while it occurs.",
    "14.10.2  Concurrent Mode\nWhen MODE = 00 , the scanner is in Concurrent mode. Concurrent mode, like Burst mode, stalls the CPU while performing accesses of memory. However, while Burst mode stalls until all accesses are complete, Concurrent mode allows the CPU to execute in between access cycles.",
    "14.10.3  Triggered mode\nWhen MODE = 11 , the scanner is in Triggered mode. Triggered mode behaves identically to Concurrent mode, except instead of beginning the scan immediately upon the SCANGO bit being set, it waits for a rising edge from a separate trigger source which is determined by the SCANTRIG register.",
    "14.10.4  Peek Mode\nWhen MODE = 10 , the scanner is in Peek mode. Peek mode waits for an instruction cycle in which the CPU does not need to access the NVM (such as a branch instruction) and uses that cycle to do its own NVM access. This results in the lowest throughput for the NVM access (and can take a much longer time to complete a scan than the other modes), but does so without any impact on execution times, unlike the other modes.",

    "15. Interrupts\nThe PIC18(L)F65/66K40 devices have multiple interrupt sources and an interrupt priority feature that allows most interrupt sources to be assigned a high or low-priority level. The high-priority interrupt vector is at 0008h and the low-priority interrupt vector is at 0018h. A high-priority interrupt event will interrupt a low-priority interrupt that may be in progress.\nThe registers for controlling interrupt operation are:\n\u00b7 INTCON\n\u00b7 PIRx (Interrupt flags)\n\u00b7 PIEx (Interrupt enables)\n\u00b7 IPRx (High/Low interrupt priority)\nIt is recommended that the Microchip header files supplied with MPLAB  IDE be used for the \u00ae symbolic bit names in these registers. This allows the assembler/compiler to automatically take care of the placement of these bits within the specified register.\nIn general, interrupt sources have three bits to control their operation. They are:\n\u00b7 Flag bit to indicate that an interrupt event occurred\n\u00b7 Enable bit that allows program execution to branch to the interrupt vector address when the flag bit is set\n\u00b7 Priority bit to select high priority or low priority",
    "15.1 Midrange Compatibility\nWhen the IPEN bit is cleared (default state), the interrupt priority feature is disabled and interrupts are compatible with PIC  microcontroller midrange devices. In Compatibility mode, the interrupt \u00ae priority bits of the IPRx registers have no effect. The PEIE/GIEL bit is the global interrupt enable for the peripherals. The PEIE/GIEL bit disables only the peripheral interrupt sources and enables the peripheral interrupt sources when the GIE/GIEH bit is also set. The GIE/GIEH bit is the global interrupt enable which enables all non-peripheral interrupt sources and disables all interrupt sources, including the peripherals. All interrupts branch to address 0008h in Compatibility mode.",
    "15.2 Interrupt Priority\nThe interrupt priority feature is enabled by setting the IPEN bit. When interrupt priority is enabled the GIE/GIEH and PEIE/GIEL Global Interrupt Enable bits of Compatibility mode are replaced by the GIEH high priority, and GIEL low priority, global interrupt enables. When the IPEN bit is set, the GIEH bit enables all interrupts which have their associated bit in the IPRx register set. When the GIEH bit is cleared, then all interrupt sources including those selected as low priority in the IPRx register are disabled.\nWhen both GIEH and GIEL bits are set, all interrupts selected as low priority sources are enabled.\nA high-priority interrupt will vector immediately to address 00 0008h and a low-priority interrupt will vector to address 00 0018h.",
    "15.3 Interrupt Response\nWhen an interrupt is responded to, the Global Interrupt Enable bit is cleared to disable further interrupts. The GIE/GIEH bit is the Global Interrupt Enable when the IPEN bit is cleared. When the IPEN bit is set, enabling interrupt priority levels, the GIEH bit is the high priority Global Interrupt Enable and the GIEL bit is the low priority Global Interrupt Enable. High-priority interrupt sources can interrupt a low-priority interrupt. Low-priority interrupts are not processed while high-priority interrupts are in progress.\nThe return address is pushed onto the stack and the PC is loaded with the interrupt vector address (0008h or 0018h). Once in the Interrupt Service Routine, the source(s) of the interrupt can be\ndetermined by polling the interrupt flag bits in the INTCONx and PIRx registers. The interrupt flag bits must be cleared by software before re-enabling interrupts to avoid repeating the same interrupt.\nThe 'return from interrupt' instruction, RETFIE , exits the interrupt routine and sets the GIE/GIEH bit (GIEH or GIEL if priority levels are used), which re-enables interrupts.",
    "15.3 Interrupt Response\nFor external interrupt events, such as the INT pins or the interrupt-on-change pins, the interrupt latency will be three to four instruction cycles. The exact latency is the same for one-cycle or two-cycle instructions. Individual interrupt flag bits are set, regardless of the status of their corresponding enable bits or the Global Interrupt Enable bit.\nImportant: Do not use the MOVFF instruction to modify any of the interrupt control registers while any interrupt is enabled. Doing so may cause erratic microcontroller behavior. Filename: 10-000010B.vsd Title: Generic Interrupt Logic for PIC18 Last Edit: 5/4/2016\nFirst Used:\nFigure 15-1.

    "15.8 INTn Pin Interrupts\nPIC18(L)F65/66K40 devices have 4 external interrupt sources which can be assigned to any pin on PORTA and PORTB using PPS. The external interrupt sources are edge-triggered. If the corresponding INTxEDG bit in the INTCON register is set (= 1 ), the interrupt is triggered by a rising edge. It the bit is clear, the trigger is on the falling edge.\nAll external interrupts (INT0, INT1, INT2, INT3) can wake up the processor from Idle or Sleep modes if bit INTxE was set prior to going into those modes. If the Global Interrupt Enable bit (GIE/GIEH) is set, the processor will branch to the interrupt vector following wake-up.\nInterrupt priority is determined by the value contained in the corresponding interrupt priority bit (INT0P, INT1P, INT2P, INT3) of the IPR0 register.",
    "15.9 TMR0 Interrupt\nIn 8-bit mode (which is the default), an overflow in the TMR0 register (FFh \u2192 00h) will set flag bit, TMR0IF. In 16-bit mode, an overflow in the TMR0H:TMR0L register pair (FFFFh \u2192 0000h) will set TMR0IF. The interrupt can be enabled or disabled by setting or clearing the enable bit, TMR0IE. Interrupt priority for Timer0 is determined by the value contained in the interrupt priority bit, TMR0IP. See 'TMR0 - Timer0 Module' chapter for further details on the Timer0 module.",

    "15.10 Interrupt-on-Change\nAn input change on any port pins that support IOC sets Flag bit, IOCIF. The interrupt can be enabled/ disabled by setting/clearing the enable bit, IOCIE. Pins must also be individually enabled in the IOCxP and IOCxN register. IOCIF is a read-only bit and the flag can be cleared by clearing the corresponding IOCxF registers. For more information, refer to the 'Interrupt-on-Change' chapter.",

    "15.11 Context Saving During Interrupts\nDuring interrupts, the return PC address is saved on the stack. Additionally, the WREG, STATUS and BSR registers are saved on the fast return stack. If a fast return from interrupt is not used the user may need to save the WREG, STATUS and BSR registers on entry to the Interrupt Service Routine. Depending on the user's application, other registers may also need to be saved. Saving Status, WREG and BSR Registers in RAM saves and restores the WREG, STATUS and BSR registers during an Interrupt Service Routine.",

    "16. I/O Ports\nMost port pins share functions with device peripherals, both analog and digital. In general, when a peripheral is enabled on a port pin, that pin cannot be used as a general purpose output; however, the pin can still be read.\nThe Data Latch (LATx registers) is useful for read-modify-write operations on the value that the I/O pins are driving.\nA write operation to the LATx register has the same effect as a write to the corresponding PORTx register. A read of the LATx register reads of the values held in the I/O PORT latches, while a read of the PORTx register reads the actual I/O pin value.\nPorts that support analog inputs have an associated ANSELx register. When an ANSELx bit is set, the digital input buffer associated with that bit is disabled.\nDisabling the input buffer prevents analog signal levels on the pin between a logic high and low from causing excessive current in the logic input circuitry. A simplified model of a generic I/O port, without the interfaces to other peripherals, is shown in the following figure:\nFigure 16-1. Generic I/O Port Operation",
    "16.1 I/O Priorities\nEach pin defaults to the PORT data latch after Reset. Other functions are selected with the peripheral pin select logic. See the 'PPS - Peripheral Pin Select Module' chapter for more information.\nAnalog input functions, such as ADC and comparator inputs, are not shown in the peripheral pin select lists. These inputs are active when the I/O pin is set for Analog mode using the ANSELx register. Digital output functions may continue to control the pin when it is in Analog mode.\nAnalog outputs, when enabled, take priority over digital outputs and force the digital output driver into a High-Impedance state.\nThe pin function priorities are as follows:\n1. Configuration bits\n2. Analog outputs (disable the input buffers)\n3. Analog inputs\n4. Port inputs and outputs from PPS",

    "16.2 PORTx Registers\nIn this section the generic names such as PORTx, LATx, TRISx, etc. can be associated with all ports.",
    "16.2.1 Data Register\nPORTx is an 8-bit wide, bidirectional port. The corresponding data direction register is TRISx. Setting a TRISx bit (' 1 ') will make the corresponding PORTA pin an input (i.e., disable the output driver). Clearing a TRISx bit (' 0 ') will make the corresponding PORTx pin an output (i.e., it enables output driver and puts the contents of the output latch on the selected pin). Example 16-1 shows how to initialize PORTA.\nReading the PORTx register reads the status of the pins, whereas writing to it will write to the PORT latch. All write operations are read-modify-write operations. Therefore, a write to a port implies that the port pins are read, this value is modified and then written to the PORT data latch (LATx).\nThe PORT data latch LATx holds the output port data and contains the latest value of a LATx or PORTx write.",

    "16.2.2 Direction Control\nThe TRISx register controls the PORTx pin output drivers, even when they are being used as analog inputs. The user must ensure the bits in the TRISx register are maintained set when using them as analog inputs. I/O pins configured as analog inputs always read as ' 0 '.",

    "16.2.3 Analog Control\nThe ANSELx register is used to configure the Input mode of an I/O pin to analog. Setting the appropriate ANSELx bit high will cause all digital reads on the pin to be read as ' 0 ' and allow analog functions on the pin to operate correctly.\nThe state of the ANSELx bits has no effect on digital output functions. A pin with TRIS clear and ANSEL set will still operate as a digital output, but the Input mode will be analog. This can cause unexpected behavior when executing READ-MODIFY-WRITE instructions on the affected port.\nImportant: The ANSELx bits default to the Analog mode after Reset. To use any pins as digital general purpose or peripheral inputs, the corresponding ANSEL bits must be initialized to ' 0 ' by user software.",

When an ODCONx bit is set, the corresponding port output becomes an open-drain driver capable of sinking current only. When an ODCONx bit is cleared, the corresponding port output pin is the standard push-pull drive capable of sourcing and sinking current.\nImportant: It is not necessary to set open-drain control when using the pin for I 2 C; the I 2 C module controls the pin and makes the pin open-drain.",

    "17.2 Overview\nAll the pins of PORTB, PORTC, PORTE, and pin RG5 of PORTG can be configured to operate as Interrupt-on-Change (IOC) pins on PIC18(L)F65/66K40 family devices. An interrupt can be generated by detecting a signal that has either a rising edge or a falling edge. Any individual port pin, or combination of port pins, can be configured to generate an interrupt.",
    "17.3 Block Diagram\nFigure 17-1. Interrupt-on-Change Block Diagram (PORTB Example)",
    "17.4 Enabling the Module\nTo allow individual port pins to generate an interrupt, the IOCIE bit of the PIE0 register must be set. If the IOCIE bit is disabled, the edge detection on the pin will still occur, but an interrupt will not be generated.",
    "17.5 Individual Pin Configuration\nFor each PORT pin, a rising edge detector and a falling edge detector are present. To enable a pin to detect a rising edge, the associated bit of the IOCxP register is set. To enable a pin to detect a falling edge, the associated bit of the IOCxN register is set.\nA pin can be configured to detect rising and falling edges simultaneously by setting both associated bits of the IOCxP and IOCxN registers, respectively.",
    "17.6 Interrupt Flags\nThe IOCBFx, IOCCFx, IOCEFx and IOCGF5 bits located in the IOCBF, IOCCF, IOCEF and IOCGF registers respectively, are status flags that correspond to the interrupt-on-change pins of the associated port. If an expected edge is detected on an appropriately enabled pin, then the status flag for that pin will be set, and an interrupt will be generated if the IOCIE bit is set. The IOCIF bit of the PIR0 register reflects the status of all IOCBFx, IOCCFx, IOCEFx and IOCGF5 bits.",
    "17.7 Clearing Interrupt Flags\nThe individual status flag bits (IOCBFx, IOCCFx, IOCEFx and IOCGF5) can be cleared by resetting them to zero. If another edge is detected during this clearing operation, the associated status flag will be set at the end of the sequence, regardless of the value actually being written.\nTo ensure that no detected edge is lost while clearing flags, only AND operations masking out known changed bits must be performed. The following sequence is an example of what must be performed.",
    "17.8 Operation in Sleep\nThe interrupt-on-change interrupt sequence will wake the device from Sleep mode, if the IOCIE bit is set.\nIf an edge is detected while in Sleep mode, the IOCxF register will be updated prior to the first instruction executed out of Sleep.",

    "18. PPS - Peripheral Pin Select Module\nThe Peripheral Pin Select (PPS) module connects peripheral inputs and outputs to the device I/O pins. Only digital signals are included in the selections. All analog inputs and outputs remain fixed to their assigned pins. Input and output selections are independent as shown in the figure below.\nThe peripheral input is selected with the peripheral xxxPPS register, and the peripheral output is selected with the PORT RxyPPS register. For example, to select PORTC[7] as the EUSART RX input, set RXxPPS to 0x17 as shown in the input table, and to select PORTC[6] as the EUSART TX output set RC6PPS to 0x0C as shown in the output table.\nFigure 18-1. Simplified PPS Block Diagram",
    "18.1 PPS Inputs\nEach peripheral has a PPS register with which the input pin to the peripheral is selected. Although each peripheral has its own PPS input selection register, the selections are identical for every peripheral, as shown in xxxPPS. Not all ports are available for input, as shown in the 'PPS Input Selection Register Details' table.\nMultiple peripherals can operate from the same source simultaneously. Port reads always return the pin level regardless of peripheral PPS selection. If a pin also has analog functions associated, the ANSEL bit for that pin must be cleared to enable the digital input buffer.\nImportant: The notation 'xxx' in the generic register name is a placeholder for the peripheral identifier. For example, xxx = INT for the INTPPS register.\n\nTable 18-1. PPS Input Selection Register Details",

Clock and data signals can be routed to any pin, however pins without I 2 C compatibility will operate at standard TTL/ST logic levels as selected by the INLVL register. See the INLVL register for each port to determine which pins are I 2 C and SMBus compatible.",
    "18.4 PPS Lock\nThe PPS includes a mode in which all input and output selections can be locked to prevent inadvertent changes. PPS selections are locked by setting the PPSLOCKED bit of the PPSLOCK register. Setting and clearing this bit requires a special sequence as an extra precaution against\ninadvertent changes. Examples of setting and clearing the PPSLOCKED bit are shown in the following examples.\n```\nExample 18-1.

    "18.5 PPS One-Way Lock\nUsing the PPS1WAY Configuration bit, the PPS settings can be locked in. When this bit is set, the PPSLOCKED bit can only be cleared and set one time after a device Reset. This allows for clearing the PPSLOCKED bit so that the input and output selections can be made during initialization. When the PPSLOCKED bit is set after all selections have been made, it will remain set and cannot be cleared until after the next device Reset event.",

Similarly, a write to the high byte of Timer0 takes place through the TMR0H buffer register. The high byte is updated with the contents of the TMR0H register when a write occurs to the TMR0L register. This allows all 16 bits of Timer0 to be read and written at the same time.\nTimer0 rolls over to 0x0000 on incrementing past 0xFFFF. This makes the timer free-running.

Due to this condition, a 2 LSB error in resolution will occur when reading the Timer1 value. To utilize the full resolution of Timer1, an asynchronous input signal must be used to gate the Timer1 clock input.\nImportant: In Counter mode, a falling edge must be registered by the counter prior to the first incrementing rising edge after any one or more of the following conditions:\n\u00b7 Timer1 enabled after POR\n\u00b7 Write to TMRxH or TMRxL\n\u00b7 Timer1 is disabled\n\u00b7 Timer1 is disabled (TMRxON = 0 ) when TxCKI is high then Timer1 is enabled (TMRxON = 1 ) when TxCKI is low.

The secondary oscillator is not dedicated only to Timer1; it can also be used by other modules.\nThe oscillator circuit is enabled by setting the SOSCEN bit of the OSCEN register. This can be used as one of the Timer1 clock sources selected with the CS bits. The oscillator will continue to run during Sleep.\nImportant: The oscillator requires a start-up and stabilization time before use. Thus, the SOSCEN bit of the OSCEN register needs to be set and a suitable delay observed prior to enabling Timer1.

However, special precautions in software are needed to read/write the timer (see Reading and Writing Timer1 in Asynchronous Counter Mode).\nImportant: When switching from synchronous to asynchronous operation, it is possible to skip an increment. When switching from asynchronous to synchronous operation, it is possible to produce an additional increment.",
    "20.5.1 Reading and Writing Timer1 in Asynchronous Counter Mode\nReading TMRxH or TMRxL while the timer is running from an external asynchronous clock will ensure a valid read (taken care of in hardware). However, reading the 16-bit timer in two 8-bit values itself poses certain problems, since the timer may overflow between the reads. For writes, it is recommended that the user simply stops the timer and writes the desired values. A write contention may occur by writing to the timer registers, while the register is incrementing. This may produce an unpredictable value in the TMRxH:TMRxL register pair.",

The 16-bit read and write operations are enabled by setting the RD16 bit.\nTo accomplish this function, the TMRxH register value is mapped to a buffer register called the TMRxH buffer register. While in 16-bit mode, the TMRxH register is not directly readable or writable and all read and write operations take place through the use of this TMRxH buffer register.\nWhen a read from the TMRxL register is requested, the value of the TMRxH register is simultaneously loaded into the TMRxH buffer register. When a read from the TMRxH register is requested, the value is provided from the TMRxH buffer register instead. This provides the user with the ability to accurately read all 16 bits of the Timer1 value from a single instance in time. Refer to the figure below for more details.",
    "20.6 Timer1 16-Bit Read/Write Mode\nIn contrast, when not in 16-bit mode, the user must read each register separately and determine if the values have become invalid due to a rollover that may have occurred between the read operations.\nWhen a write request of the TMRxL register is requested, the TMRxH buffer register is simultaneously updated with the contents of the TMRxH register. The value of TMRxH must be preloaded into the TMRxH buffer register prior to the write request for the TMRxL register. This provides the user with the ability to write all 16 bits to the TMRxL:TMRxH register pair at the same time.\nAny requests to write to TMRxH directly does not clear the Timer1 prescaler value. The prescaler value is only cleared through write requests to the TMRxL register.\nFigure 20-3. Timer1 16-Bit Read/Write Mode Block Diagram",

    "20.7.3 Timer1 Gate Toggle Mode\nWhen Timer1 Gate Toggle mode is enabled, it is possible to measure the full-cycle length of a Timer1 Gate signal, as opposed to the duration of a single level pulse.\nThe Timer1 gate source is routed through a flip-flop that changes state on every incrementing edge of the signal. See the figure below for timing details.\nTimer1 Gate Toggle mode is enabled by setting the GTM bit. When the GTM bit is cleared, the flip-flop is cleared and held clear. This is necessary to control which edge is measured.\nImportant: Enabling Toggle mode at the same time as changing the gate polarity may result in indeterminate operation.",

    "20.7.4 Timer1 Gate Single Pulse Mode\nWhen Timer1 Gate Single Pulse mode is enabled, it is possible to capture a single pulse gate event. Timer1 Gate Single Pulse mode is first enabled by setting the GSPM bit in the TxGCON register. Next, the GGO/DONE bit in the TxGCON register must be set. The Timer1 will be fully enabled on the next incrementing edge. On the next trailing edge of the pulse, the GGO/DONE bit will automatically be cleared. No other gate events will be allowed to increment Timer1 until the GGO/DONE bit is once again set in software.\nClearing the GSPM bit will also clear the GGO/DONE bit. See the figure below for timing details.\nEnabling the Toggle mode and the Single Pulse mode simultaneously will permit both sections to work together. This allows the cycle times on the Timer1 gate source to be measured. See the figure below for timing details.",

    "20.7.6 Timer1 Gate Event Interrupt\nWhen Timer1 gate event interrupt is enabled, it is possible to generate an interrupt upon the completion of a gate event. When the falling edge of GVAL occurs, the TMRxGIF flag bit in the PIR5 register will be set. If the TMRxGIE bit in the PIE5 register is set, then an interrupt will be recognized.\nThe TMRxGIF flag bit operates even when the Timer1 gate is not enabled (the GE bit is cleared).\nFor more information on selecting high or low priority status for the Timer1 gate event interrupt, refer to the 'Interrupts' chapter.\nImportant: A pulse signal with minimum 100 ns width must be applied to TxGATE for proper operation. Any TxGATE pulse width that is shorter than 100 ns cannot be relied on to trigger an interrupt.",

    "20.10 CCP Capture/Compare Time Base\nThe CCP modules use the TMRxH:TMRxL register pair as the time base when operating in Capture or Compare mode.\nIn Capture mode, the value in the TMRxH:TMRxL register pair is copied into the CCPRxH:CCPRxL register pair on a configured event.\nIn Compare mode, an event is triggered when the value in the CCPRxH:CCPRxL register pair matches the value in the TMRxH:TMRxL register pair. This event can be a Special Event Trigger.\nFor more information, see the 'Capture/Compare/PWM Module' chapter.",

This special event does not cause a Timer1 interrupt. The CCP module may still be configured to generate a CCP interrupt.\nIn this mode of operation, the CCPRxH:CCPRxL register pair becomes the period register for Timer1.\nTimer1 must be synchronized and FOSC/4 must be selected as the clock source to utilize the Special Event Trigger. Asynchronous operation of Timer1 can cause a Special Event Trigger to be missed.\nIn the event that a write to TMRxH or TMRxL coincides with a Special Event Trigger from the CCP, the write will take precedence.",

This will reduce power consumption to an absolute minimum. Setting the PMD bits holds the module in Reset and disconnects the module's clock source. The Module Disable bits for Timer1 (TMR1MD) are in the PMD1 register. See the 'PMD - Peripheral Module Disable' chapter for more information.",

    "21.1 Timer2 Operation\nTimer2 operates in three major modes:\n\u00b7 Free Running Period\n\u00b7 One Shot\n\u00b7 Monostable\nWithin each mode there are several options for starting, stopping, and reset. Table 21-1 lists the options.\nIn all modes, the T2TMR count register is incremented on the rising edge of the clock signal from the programmable prescaler. When T2TMR equals T2PR, a high level is output to the postscaler counter. T2TMR is cleared on the next clock input.\nAn external signal from hardware can also be configured to gate the timer operation or force a T2TMR count Reset. In Gate modes, the counter stops when the gate is disabled and resumes when the gate is enabled. In Reset modes, the T2TMR count is reset on either the level or edge from the external source.\nThe T2TMR and T2PR registers are both directly readable and writable. The T2TMR register is cleared and the T2PR register initializes to FFh on any device Reset. Both the prescaler and postscaler counters are cleared on the following events:",

    "21.1.1 Free-Running Period Mode\nThe value of T2TMR is compared to that of the Period register, T2PR, on each clock cycle. When the two values match, the comparator resets the value of T2TMR to 00h on the next cycle and increments the output postscaler counter. When the postscaler count equals the value in the OUTPS bits of the T2CON register then a one clock period wide pulse occurs on the TMR2_postscaled output, and the postscaler count is cleared.",
    "21.1.2 One Shot Mode\nThe One Shot mode is identical to the Free-Running Period mode, except that the ON bit is cleared and the timer is stopped when T2TMR matches T2PR and will not restart until the ON bit is cycled off and on. Postscaler (OUTPS) values other than zero are ignored in this mode because the timer is stopped at the first period event and the postscaler is reset when the timer is restarted.",
    "21.1.3 Monostable Mode\nMonostable modes are similar to One Shot modes except that the ON bit is not cleared and the timer can be restarted by an external Reset event.",
    "21.2 Timer2 Output\nThe Timer2 module's primary output is TMR2_postscaled, which pulses for a single TMR2_clk period upon each match of the postscaler counter and the OUTPS bits of the T2CON register. The postscaler is incremented each time the T2TMR value matches the T2PR value. This signal can be selected as an input to several other input modules:\n\u00b7 The ADC module, as an auto-conversion trigger\n\u00b7 CWG, as an auto-shutdown source\n\u00b7 The CRC memory scanner, as a trigger for triggered mode\n\u00b7 Gate source for odd numbered timers (Timer1, Timer3, etc.)\n\u00b7 Alternate SPI clock\n\u00b7 Reset signals for other instances of even numbered timers (Timer2, Timer4, etc.)\nIn addition, the Timer2 is also used by the CCP module for pulse generation in PWM mode. See the 'PWM Overview' and 'Pulse-Width Modulation' sections for details on setting up Timer2 for use with the CCP and PWM modules.",
    "Related Links\nPWM Overview\nPWM - Pulse-Width Modulation",
    "21.3 External Reset Sources\nIn addition to the clock source, the Timer2 also takes in an external Reset source. This external Reset source is selected for each timer with the corresponding TxRST register. This source can control starting and stopping of the timer, as well as resetting the timer, depending on which mode the timer is in. Reset source selections are shown in the following table.\nRefer to the External Reset Sources table for further information.",
    "21.4 Timer2 Interrupt\nTimer2 can also generate a device interrupt. The interrupt is generated when the postscaler counter matches with the selected postscaler value (OUTPS bits of T2CON register). The interrupt is enabled by setting the TMR2IE interrupt enable bit. Interrupt timing is illustrated in the figure below.\nFigure 21-2.

    "Notes:\n1. Setting the interrupt flag is synchronized with the instruction clock.\n2. Cleared by software.",
    "21.5 PSYNC Bit\nSetting the PSYNC bit synchronizes the prescaler output to F OSC/4. Setting this bit is required for reading the Timer2 counter register while the selected Timer clock is asynchronous to F OSC/4.\nNote: Setting PSYNC requires that the output of the prescaler is slower than F OSC/4. Setting PSYNC when the output of the prescaler is greater than or equal to F OSC/4 may cause unexpected results.",
    "21.6 CSYNC Bit\nAll bits in the Timer2 SFRs are synchronized to F OSC/4 by default, not the Timer2 input clock. As such, if the Timer2 input clock is not synchronized to F OSC/4, it is possible for the Timer2 input clock to transition at the same time as the ON bit is set in software, which may cause undesirable behavior and glitches in the counter. Setting the CSYNC bit remedies this problem by synchronizing the ON bit to the Timer2 input clock instead of F OSC/4. However, as this synchronization uses an edge of the TMR2 input clock, up to one input clock cycle will be consumed and not counted by the Timer2 when CSYNC is set. Conversely, clearing the CSYNC bit synchronizes the ON bit to F OSC/4, which does not consume any clock edges, but has the previously stated risk of glitches.",
    "21.7 Operating Modes\nThe mode of the timer is controlled by the MODE bits of the T2HLT register. Edge-Triggered modes require six Timer clock periods between external triggers. Level-Triggered modes require the triggering level to be at least three Timer clock periods long. External triggers are ignored while in Debug mode.\n\nTable 21-1.

In Capture mode, the peripheral allows the timing of the duration of an event. The Compare mode allows the user to trigger an external event when a predetermined amount of time has expired. The PWM mode can generate Pulse-Width Modulated signals of varying frequency and duty cycle.\nThis family of devices contains five standard Capture/Compare/PWM modules (CCP1, CCP2, CCP3, CCP4, and CCP5). Note that the Capture/Compare mode operation is described with respect to TMR1, and the PWM mode operation is described with respect to T2TMR in the following sections.\nThe Capture and Compare functions are identical for all CCP modules.",
    "Important:\n1. In devices with more than one CCP module, it is very important to pay close attention to the register names used. A number placed after the module acronym is used to distinguish between separate modules. For example, the CCP1CON and CCP2CON control the same operational aspects of two completely different CCP modules.\n2. Throughout this section, generic references to a CCP module in any of its operating modes may be interpreted as being equally applicable to CCPx module. Register names, module signals, I/O pins, and bit names may use the generic designator 'x' to indicate the use of a numeral to distinguish a particular module, when required.",
    "22.1 CCP Module Configuration\nEach Capture/Compare/PWM module is associated with a control register (CCPxCON), a capture input selection register (CCPxCAP) and a data register (CCPRx). The data register, in turn, is comprised of two 8-bit registers: CCPRxL (low byte) and CCPRxH (high byte).",
    "22.1.1 CCP Modules and Timer Resources\nThe CCP modules utilize Timers 1 through 6 that vary with the selected mode. Various timers are available to the CCP modules in Capture, Compare or PWM modes, as shown in the table below.\nTable 22-1. CCP Mode - Timer Resources\n\nCapture, Timer Resource = . Compare, Timer Resource = Timer1, Timer3, Timer5, or Timer7. PWM, Timer Resource = . , Timer Resource = Timer2, Timer4, Timer6, or Timer8\nThe assignment of a particular timer to a module is determined by the timer to CCP enable bits in the CCPTMRS0 and CCPTMRS1 registers. All of the modules may be active at once and may share the same timer resource if they are configured to operate in the same mode (Capture/Compare or PWM) at the same time.",
    "22.1.2 Open-Drain Output Option\nWhen operating in Output mode (the Compare or PWM modes), the drivers for the CCPx pins can be optionally configured as open-drain outputs. This feature allows the voltage level on the pin to be pulled to a higher level through an external pull-up resistor and allows the output to communicate with external circuits without the need for additional level shifters.",
    "22.2 Capture Mode\nCapture mode uses the 16-bit odd numbered Timer resources (Timer1, Timer3, etc.). When an event occurs on the capture source, the 16-bit CCPRx register captures and stores the 16-bit value of the TMRx register. An event is defined as one of the following and is configured by the MODE bits:\n\u00b7 Every falling edge of CCPx input\n\u00b7 Every rising edge of CCPx input\n\u00b7 Every 4 th  rising edge of CCPx input\n\u00b7 Every 16 th  rising edge of CCPx input\n\u00b7 Every edge of CCPx input (rising or falling)\nWhen a capture is made, the Interrupt Request Flag bit CCPxIF of the PIR6 register is set. The interrupt flag must be cleared in software. If another capture occurs before the value in the CCPRx register is read, the old captured value is overwritten by the new captured value.\nImportant: If an event occurs during a 2-byte read, the high and low-byte data will be from different events. It is recommended while reading the CCPRxH:CCPRxL register pair to either disable the module or read the register pair twice for data integrity.",

    "22.2.3 Software Interrupt Mode\nWhen the Capture mode is changed, a false capture interrupt may be generated. The user must keep the CCPxIE Interrupt Priority bit of the PIE6 register clear to avoid false interrupts. Additionally, the user must clear the CCPxIF Interrupt Flag bit of the PIR6 register following any change in Operating mode.\nImportant: Clocking Timer1 from the system clock (FOSC) may not be used in Capture mode. For Capture mode to recognize the trigger event on the CCPx pin, Timer1 must be clocked from the instruction clock (FOSC/4) or from an external clock source.",
    "22.2.4 CCP Prescaler\nThere are four prescaler settings specified by the MODE bits. Whenever the CCP module is turned off, or the CCP module is not in Capture mode, the prescaler counter is cleared. Any Reset will clear the prescaler counter.\nSwitching from one capture prescaler to another does not clear the prescaler and may generate a false interrupt. To avoid this unexpected operation, turn the module off by clearing the CCPxCON register before changing the prescaler. The example below demonstrates the code to perform this function.",
    "22.2.5 Capture During Sleep\nCapture mode depends upon the Timer1 module for proper operation. There are two options for driving the Timer1 module in Capture mode. It can be driven by the instruction clock (F OSC/4), or by an external clock source.\nWhen Timer1 is clocked by FOSC/4, Timer1 will not increment during Sleep. When the device wakes from Sleep, Timer1 will continue from its previous state.\nCapture mode will operate during Sleep when Timer1 is clocked by an external clock source.",
    "22.3 Compare Mode\nThe Compare mode function described in this section is available and identical for all CCP modules.\nCompare mode uses the 16-bit odd numbered Timer resources (Timer1, Timer3, etc.). The 16-bit value of the CCPRx register is constantly compared against the 16-bit value of the TMRx register. When a match occurs, one of the following events can occur:\n\u00b7 Toggle the CCPx output and clear TMRx\n\u00b7 Toggle the CCPx output without clearing TMRx\n\u00b7 Set the CCPx output\n\u00b7 Clear the CCPx output\n\u00b7 Pulse output\n\u00b7 Pulse output and clear TMRx\nThe action on the pin is based on the value of the MODE control bits. At the same time, the interrupt flag CCPxIF bit is set, and an ADC conversion can be triggered, if selected.\nAll Compare modes can generate an interrupt and trigger an ADC conversion. When MODE = ' 0001 ' or ' 1011 ', the CCP resets the TMRx register.\nThe following figure shows a simplified diagram of the compare operation.\nFigure 22-2. Compare Mode Operation Block Diagram",

When this flag is set and a match occurs, an auto-conversion trigger can take place if the CCP module is selected as the conversion trigger source.\nRefer to the 'Auto-Conversion Trigger' section for more information.\nImportant: Removing the Match condition by changing the contents of the CCPRxH and CCPRxL register pair, between the clock edge that generates the auto-conversion trigger and the clock edge that generates the Timer1 Reset, will preclude the Reset from occurring.",

    "22.4 PWM Overview\nPulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is a scheme that provides power to a load by switching quickly between fully ON and fully OFF states. The PWM signal resembles a square wave where the high portion of the signal is considered the ON state and the low portion of the signal is considered the OFF state. The high portion, also known as the pulse width, can vary in time and is defined in steps. A larger number of steps applied, which lengthens the pulse width, also supplies more power to the load. Lowering the number of steps applied, which shortens the pulse width, supplies less power. The PWM period is defined as the duration of one complete cycle or the total amount of ON and OFF time combined.\nPWM resolution defines the maximum number of steps that can be present in a single PWM period. A higher resolution allows for more precise control of the pulse-width time and in turn the power that is applied to the load.",
    "22.4 PWM Overview\nThe term duty cycle describes the proportion of the ON time to the OFF time and is expressed in percentages, where 0% is fully OFF and 100% is fully ON. A lower duty cycle corresponds to less power applied and a higher duty cycle corresponds to more power applied.\nThe figure below shows a typical waveform of the PWM signal.",

The default selection for PWMx is TMR2. Note that the PWM module operation in the following sections is described with respect to TMR2. Timer2 and T2PR set the period of the PWM. The PWMxDCL and PWMxDCH registers configure the duty cycle. The period is common to all PWM modules, whereas the duty cycle is independently controlled.\nImportant: The Timer2 postscaler is not used in the determination of the PWM frequency. The postscaler might be used to have a servo update rate at a different frequency than the PWM output.",

Each PWMx is cleared when TxTMR is equal to the value specified in the corresponding PWMxDCH (8 MSb) and PWMxDCL[7:6] (2 LSb) registers. When the value is greater than or equal to T2PR, the PWM output is never cleared (100% duty cycle).\nImportant: The PWMxDCH and PWMxDCL registers are double-buffered.

    "24. ZCD - Zero-Cross Detection Module\nThe Zero-Cross Detection (ZCD) module detects when an A/C signal crosses through the ground potential. The actual zero-crossing threshold is the zero-crossing reference voltage, Z CPINV , which is typically 0.75V above ground.\nThe connection to the signal to be detected is through a series current-limiting resistor. The module applies a current source or sink to the ZCD pin to maintain a constant voltage on the pin, thereby preventing the pin voltage from forward biasing the ESD protection diodes. When the applied voltage is greater than the reference voltage, the module sinks current. When the applied voltage is less than the reference voltage, the module sources current. The current source and sink action keeps the pin voltage constant over the full range of the applied voltage. The ZCD module is shown in the following simplified block diagram. Filename: 10-000194B.vsd Title: ZERO CROSS DETECT BLOCK DIAGRAM Last Edit: 5/14/2014 First Used: PIC16(L)F1615\nNotes:\nFigure 24-1. Simplified ZCD Block Diagram",

    "24.1 External Resistor Selection\nThe ZCD module requires a current-limiting resistor in series with the external voltage source. The impedance and rating of this resistor depends on the external source peak voltage. Select a resistor value that will drop all of the peak voltage when the current through the resistor is nominally 300 \u03bcA. Make sure that the ZCD I/O pin internal weak pull-up is disabled so it does not interfere with the current source and sink.\nEquation 24-1. External Resistor\nFigure 24-2. External Voltage Source\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->",
    "24.2 ZCD Logic Output\nThe ZCD module includes a Status bit, which can be read to determine whether the current source or sink is active. The OUT bit is set when the current sink is active, and cleared when the current source is active. The OUT bit is affected by the polarity bit.\nThe OUT signal can also be used as input to other modules. This is controlled by the registers of the corresponding module. OUT can be used as follows:\n\u00b7 Gate source for TMR1/3/5/7\n\u00b7 Clock source for TMR2/4/6/8\n\u00b7 Reset source for TMR2/4/6/8",
    "24.3 ZCD Logic Polarity\nThe POL bit inverts the OUT bit relative to the current source and sink output. When the POL bit is set, a OUT high indicates that the current source is active, and a low output indicates that the current sink is active.\nThe POL bit affects the ZCD interrupts.",
    "24.4 ZCD Interrupts\nAn interrupt will be generated upon a change in the ZCD logic output when the appropriate interrupt enables are set. A rising edge detector and a falling edge detector are present in the ZCD for this purpose.\nThe ZCDIF bit of the PIR2 register will be set when either edge detector is triggered and its associated enable bit is set. The INTP bit in the ZCDxCON register enables rising edge interrupts and the INTN bit in the ZCDxCON register enables falling edge interrupts.\nTo fully enable the interrupt, the following bits must be set:\n- \u00b7 ZCDIE bit of the PIE2 register\n\u00b7 INTP bit for rising edge detection\n\u00b7 INTN bit for falling edge detection\n\u00b7 PEIE and GIE bits of the INTCON register\nChanging the POL bit will cause an interrupt, regardless of the level of the SEN bit.\nThe ZCDIF bit of the PIR2 register must be cleared in software as part of the interrupt service. If another edge is detected while this flag is being cleared, the flag will still be set at the end of the sequence.",
    "24.5 Correction for Z CPINV Offset\nThe actual voltage at which the ZCD switches is the reference voltage at the noninverting input of the ZCD op amp. For external voltage source waveforms other than square waves, this voltage offset from zero causes the zero-cross event to occur either too early or too late.",
    "24.5.1 Correction by AC Coupling\nWhen the external voltage source is sinusoidal, the effects of the Z CPINV offset can be eliminated by isolating the external voltage source from the ZCD pin with a capacitor, in addition to the voltage reducing resistor. The capacitor will cause a phase shift resulting in the ZCD output switch in advance of the actual zero-crossing event. The phase shift will be the same for both rising and falling zero-crossings, which can be compensated for by either delaying the CPU response to the ZCD switch by a timer or other means, or selecting a capacitor value large enough that the phase shift is negligible.\nTo determine the series resistor and capacitor values for this configuration, start by computing the impedance, Z, to obtain a peak current of 300 \u03bcA. Next, arbitrarily select a suitably large nonpolar capacitor and compute its reactance, XC, at the external voltage source frequency. Finally, compute the series resistor, capacitor peak voltage, and phase shift by the formulas shown below.",
    "24.5.1 Correction by AC Coupling\nWhen this technique is used and the input signal is not present, the ZCD will tend to oscillate.

The resistor adds a bias to the ZCD pin so that the target external voltage source must go to zero to pull the pin voltage to the Z CPINV switching voltage. The pull-up or pull-down value can be determined with the equations shown below.\nEquation 24-5.

The maximum peak voltage can be no more than six times the minimum peak voltage. To ensure that the maximum current does not exceed \u00b1 600 \u03bcA and the minimum is at least \u00b1 100 \u03bcA, compute the series resistance as shown in Equation 24-6. The compensating pull-up for this series resistance can be determined with the equations shown in Equation 24-5, because the pull-up value is independent from the peak voltage.\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->",

    "24.9 Disabling the ZCD Module\nThe ZCD module can be disabled in two ways:\n- 1. The ZCD Configuration bit disables the ZCD module when set. When this is the case then the ZCD module will be enabled by setting the SEN bit. When the ZCD bit is cleared, the ZCD is always enabled and the SEN bit has no effect.\n- 2.

This is referred to as dead time and is covered in section Dead-Band Control.\nIt may be necessary to guard against the possibility of circuit faults or a feedback event arriving too late or not at all. In this case, the active drive must be terminated before the Fault condition causes damage. This is referred to as auto-shutdown and is covered in section Auto-Shutdown.",

A basic block diagram for the Push-Pull mode is shown in Figure 25-4.\nThe push-pull sequencer is reset whenever EN = 0 or if an auto-shutdown event occurs.

The direction of the CWG output changes when the duty cycle of the data input is at or near 100%, or\n2. The turn-off time of the power switch, including the power device and driver circuit, is greater than the turn-on time.\nThe dead-band delay is inserted only when changing directions, and only the modulated output is affected. The statically-configured outputs (CWGxA and CWGxC) are not afforded dead band, and switch essentially simultaneously.\nThe following figure shows an example of the CWG outputs changing directions from forward to reverse, at near 100% duty cycle. In this example, at time t1, the output of CWGxA and CWGxD become inactive, while output CWGxC becomes active. Since the turn-off time of the power devices is longer than the turn-on time, a shoot-through current will flow through power devices QC and QD for the duration of 't'. The same phenomenon will occur to power devices QA and QB for the CWG direction change from reverse to forward.",
    "25.2.3.2 Dead-Band Delay in Full-Bridge Mode\nWhen changing the CWG direction at high duty cycle is required for an application, two possible solutions for eliminating the shoot-through current are:\n1. Reduce the CWG duty cycle for one period before changing directions.\n2. Use switch drivers that can drive the switches off faster than they can drive them on.",

    "25.2.4.2 Asynchronous Steering Mode\nIn Asynchronous mode (MODE = 000 ), steering takes effect at the end of the instruction cycle that writes to STRx. In Asynchronous Steering mode, the output signal may be an incomplete waveform (see the figure below). This operation may be useful when the user firmware needs to immediately remove a signal from the output pin.\nFigure 25-11. Example of Asynchronous Steering (MODE = 000 )",

Dead-band operation is employed for Half-Bridge and Full-Bridge modes. The CWG contains two 6-bit dead-band counters. One is used for the rising edge of the input source control in Half-Bridge mode or for reverse dead band in Full-Bridge mode. The other is used for the falling edge of the input source control in Half-Bridge mode or for forward dead band in Full-Bridge mode.\nDead band is timed by counting CWG clock periods from zero up to the value in the rising or falling dead-band counter registers.",

The CWGxA and CWGxC signals will change immediately upon the first rising input edge following a direction change, but the modulated signals (CWGxB or CWGxD, depending on the direction of the change) will experience a delay dictated by the dead-band counters.",

Refer to the table below for possible clock source options.\nThe polarity of the clock source can be selected using the CPOL bit in the SMTxCON0 register.",

It can be written to and read by software. It is not guarded for atomic access, therefore reads and writes to the SMTxTMR may be made when the GO = 0 .\nThe counter can be prevented from a rollover using the STP bit in the SMTxCON0 register.

Note that all waveforms assume WPOL/SPOL/CPOL = 0 . For all modes, the REPEAT bit controls whether the acquisition is repeated or single. When REPEAT = 0 (Single Acquisition mode), the timer will stop incrementing and the SMTxGO bit will be reset upon the completion of an acquisition. Otherwise, the timer will continue and allow for continued acquisitions to overwrite the previous ones until the timer is stopped in software.",

    "27. DSM - Data Signal Modulator Module\nThe Data Signal Modulator (DSM) is a peripheral that allows the user to mix a data stream, also known as a modulator signal, with a carrier signal to produce a modulated output.\nBoth the carrier and the modulator signals are supplied to the DSM module either internally, from the output of a peripheral, or externally through an input pin.\nThe modulated output signal is generated by performing a logical AND operation of both the carrier and modulator signals, and then provided to the MDOUT pin.\nThe carrier signal is comprised of two distinct and separate signals. A Carrier High (CARH) signal and a Carrier Low (CARL) signal. During the time in which the modulator (MOD) signal is in a Logic High state, the DSM mixes the CARH signal with the modulator signal. When the modulator signal is in a Logic Low state, the DSM mixes the CARL signal with the modulator signal.\nUsing this method, the DSM can generate the following types of key modulation schemes:\n\u00b7 Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)\n\u00b7 Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)\n\u00b7 On-Off Keying (OOK)",

Simplified Block Diagram of the Data Signal Modulator",
    "27.1 DSM Operation\nThe DSM module can be enabled by setting the EN bit in the MDCON0 register. Clearing the EN bit, disables the output of the module but retain the carrier and source signal selections. The module will resume operation when the EN bit is set again. The output of the DSM module can be rerouted to several pins using the RxyPPS register. When the EN bit is cleared the output pin is held low.",
    "27.2 Modulator Signal Sources\nThe modulator signal can be supplied from the following sources:\n\u00b7 EUSART\n\u00b7 MSSP\n\u00b7 CCP/PWM\n\u00b7 internal MDBIT\n\u00b7 I/O pin\nThe sources are selected using the SRCS bits in the MDxSRC register.",

    "27.4 Carrier Synchronization\nDuring the time when the DSM switches between carrier high and carrier low signal sources, the carrier data in the modulated output signal can become truncated. To prevent this, the carrier signal can be synchronized to the modulator signal. When synchronization is enabled, the carrier pulse that is being mixed at the time of the transition is allowed to transition low before the DSM switches over to the next carrier source.\nSynchronization is enabled separately for the carrier high and carrier low signal sources. Synchronization for the carrier high signal is enabled by setting the CHSYNC bit. Synchronization for the carrier low signal is enabled by setting the CLSYNC bit.\nThe figures below show the timing diagrams of using various synchronization methods.",

When SSPSR receives a complete byte, it is transferred to SSPxBUF and the SSPxIF interrupt is set.\nDuring transmission, SSPxBUF is not buffered. A write to SSPxBUF will write to both SSPxBUF and SSPSR.",
    "28.2 SPI Mode Operation\nTransmissions involve two Shift registers, eight bits in size, one in the host and one in the client. With either the host or the client device, data is always shifted out one bit at a time, with the Most Significant bit (MSb) shifted out first. At the same time, a new Least Significant bit (LSb) is shifted into the same register.\n\uf0e3\nRev. 30-000012A 3/31/2017\nThe following figure shows a typical connection between two processors configured as host and client devices.",
    "Figure 28-3. SPI Host/Client Connection\nRev/ 30-000013A\nData is shifted out of both Shift registers on the programmed clock edge and latched onto the opposite edge of the clock.\nThe host device transmits information out on its SDO output pin, which is connected to and received by the client's SDI input pin. The client device transmits information out on its SDO output pin, which is connected to and received by the host's SDI input pin.\nTo begin communication, the host device first sends out the clock signal. Both the host and the client devices need to be configured for the same clock polarity.\nThe host device starts a transmission by sending out the MSb from its Shift register. The client device reads this bit from that same line and saves it into the LSb position of its Shift register.",
    "Figure 28-3. SPI Host/Client Connection\nDuring each SPI clock cycle, a full-duplex data transmission occurs. This means that while the host device is sending out the MSb from its Shift register (on its SDO pin) and the client device is reading this bit and saving it as the LSb of its Shift register, the client device is also sending out the MSb from its Shift register (on its SDO pin) and the host device is reading this bit and saving it as the LSb of its Shift register.\nAfter eight bits have been shifted out, the host and the client have exchanged register values.\n\uf0e3 If there is more data to exchange, the Shift registers are loaded with new data and the process repeats itself.\nWhether the data is meaningful or not (dummy data), depends on the application software. This leads to three scenarios for data transmission:\n\u00b7 Host sends useful data and client sends dummy data\n\u00b7 Host sends useful data and client sends useful data\n\u00b7 Host sends dummy data and client sends useful data\nTransmissions may involve any number of clock cycles. When there is no more data to be transmitted, the host stops sending the clock signal and it deselects the client.",
    "Figure 28-3. SPI Host/Client Connection\nEvery client device connected to the bus that has not been selected through its client select line must disregard the clock and transmission signals and must not transmit out any data of its own.\nWhen initializing the SPI, several options need to be specified. This is done by programming the appropriate control bits (SSPxCON1[5:0] and SSPxSTAT[7:6]). These control bits allow the following to be specified:\n\u00b7 Host mode (SCK is the clock output)\n\u00b7 Client mode (SCK is the clock input)\n\u00b7 Clock Polarity (Idle state of SCK)\n\u00b7 Data Input Sample Phase (middle or end of data output time)\n\u00b7 Clock Edge (output data on rising/falling edge of SCK)\n\u00b7 Clock Rate (Host mode only)\n\u00b7 Client Select mode (Client mode only)",

To reset or reconfigure SPI mode, clear the SSPEN bit, re-initialize the SSPxCONx registers and then set the SSPEN bit. The SDI, SDO, SCK and SS serial port pins are selected with the PPS controls. For the pins to behave as the serial port function, some must have their data direction bits (in the TRIS register) appropriately programmed as follows:\n\u00b7 SDI must have the corresponding TRIS bit set\n\u00b7 SDO must have the corresponding TRIS bit cleared\n\u00b7 SCK (Host mode) must have the corresponding TRIS bit cleared\n\u00b7 SCK (Client mode) must have the corresponding TRIS bit set\n\u00b7 The RxyPPS and SSPxCLKPPS controls must select the same pin\n\u00b7 SS must have the corresponding TRIS bit set\nAny serial port function that is not desired may be overridden by programming the corresponding data direction (TRIS) register to the opposite value.",
    "Figure 28-3. SPI Host/Client Connection\nThe MSSP consists of a Transmit/Receive Shift Register (SSPSR) and a buffer register (SSPxBUF). The SSPSR shifts the data in and out of the device, MSb first. The SSPxBUF holds the data that was written to the SSPSR until the received data is ready. Once the eight bits of data have been received, that byte is moved to the SSPxBUF register. Then, the Buffer Full Detect (BF) bit and the Interrupt Flag (SSPxIF) bit are set. This double-buffering of the received data (SSPxBUF) allows the next byte to start reception before reading the data that was just received. Any write to the SSPxBUF register during transmission/reception of data will be ignored and the Write Collision Detect (WCOL) bit will be set. User software must clear the WCOL bit to allow the following write(s) to the SSPxBUF register to complete successfully.",
    "Figure 28-3. SPI Host/Client Connection\nWhen the application software is expecting to receive valid data, the SSPxBUF must be read before the next byte of data to transfer is written to the SSPxBUF. The Buffer Full (BF) bit indicates when SSPxBUF has been loaded with the received data (transmission is complete). When the SSPxBUF is read, the BF bit is cleared. This data may be irrelevant if the SPI is only a transmitter. The MSSP interrupt is used to determine when the transmission/reception has completed. If the interrupt method is not going to be used, then software polling can be done to ensure that a write collision does not occur.\nThe SSPSR is not directly readable or writable and can only be accessed by addressing the SSPxBUF register. Additionally, the SSPxSTAT register indicates the various Status conditions.",
    "28.2.1 SPI Host Mode\nThe host can initiate the data transfer at any time because it controls the SCK line. The host determines when the client (Processor 2, Figure 28-3) is to broadcast data by the software protocol.\nIn Host mode, the data is transmitted/received as soon as the SSPxBUF register is written to. If the SPI is only going to receive, the SDO output can be disabled (programmed as an input). The SSPSR register will continue to shift in the signal present on the SDI pin at the programmed clock rate. Once the eight bits of data have been received, that byte is moved to the SSPxBUF register and the corresponding interrupt and Status bits are set.\nThe clock polarity is selected by appropriately programming the CKP and CKE bits. Then, this will give waveforms for SPI communication as shown in Figure 28-4, Figure 28-6, Figure 28-7 and Figure 28-8, where the MSB is transmitted first.

The pin selected for output with the RxyPPS register must also be selected as the peripheral input with the SSPxCLKPPS register. The pin that is selected using the SSPxCLKPPS register must also be made a digital I/O. This is done by clearing the corresponding ANSEL bit.\nFigure 28-4.

The clock line can be observed by reading the SCK pin. The Idle state is determined by the CKP bit.\nWhile in Client mode, the external clock is supplied by the external clock source on the SCK pin. This external clock must meet the minimum high and low times as specified in the 'Electrical Specifications' chapter.\nWhile in Sleep mode, the client can transmit/receive data. The Shift register is clocked from the SCK pin input and when a byte is received, the device will generate an interrupt. If enabled, the device will wake up from Sleep.",
    "28.2.3 Daisy-Chain Configuration\nThe SPI bus can sometimes be connected in a daisy-chain configuration. The first client output is connected to the second client input, the second client output is connected to the third client input, and so on. The final client output is connected to the host input. Each client sends out, during a second group of clock pulses, an exact copy of what was received during the first group of clock\n\uf0e3\npulses. The whole chain acts as one large communication Shift register. The daisy-chain feature only requires a single Client Select line from the host device.\nThe following figure shows the block diagram of a typical daisy-chain connection when operating in SPI mode.\nFigure 28-5. SPI Daisy-Chain Connection\nRev. 30-000015A\n3/31/2017\nIn a daisy-chain configuration, only the most recent byte on the bus is required by the client. Setting the BOEN bit will enable writes to the SSPxBUF register, even if the previous byte has not been read. This allows the software to ignore data that may not apply to it.",
    "28.2.4 Client Select Synchronization\nThe Client Select can also be used to synchronize communication. The Client Select line is held high until the host device is ready to communicate. When the Client Select line is pulled low, the client knows that a new transmission is starting.\n\uf0e3 If the client fails to receive the communication properly, it will be reset at the end of the transmission, when the Client Select line returns to a high state. The client is then ready to receive a new transmission when the Client Select line is pulled low again. If the Client Select line is not used, there is a risk that the client will eventually become out of sync with the host. If the client misses a bit, it will always be one bit off in future transmissions. Use of the Client Select line allows the client and host to align themselves at the beginning of each transmission.\nThe SS pin allows a Synchronous Client mode. The SPI must be in Client mode with SS pin control enabled (SSPM = 0100 ).\nWhen the SS pin is low, transmission and reception are enabled and the SDO pin is driven.",
    "28.2.4 Client Select Synchronization\nWhen the SS pin goes high, the SDO pin is no longer driven, even if in the middle of a transmitted byte and becomes a floating output. External pull-up/pull-down resistors may be desirable depending on the application.",

When the SPI is used in Client mode with CKE set, the user must enable SS pin control.\n3. While operated in SPI Client mode, the SMP bit must remain clear.\nWhen the SPI module resets, the bit counter is forced to ' 0 '. This can be done by either forcing the SS pin to a high level or clearing the SSPEN bit.\nFigure 28-6. Client Select Synchronous Waveform\nSSPxBUF\nFigure 28-7.

After the device returns to Run mode, the module will resume transmitting and receiving data.\nIn SPI Client mode, the SPI Transmit/Receive Shift register operates asynchronously to the device. This allows the device to be placed in Sleep mode and data to be shifted into the SPI Transmit/ Receive Shift register. When all eight bits have been received, the MSSP interrupt flag bit will be set and, if enabled, will wake the device.",
    "28.3 I 2 C Mode Overview\nThe Inter-Integrated Circuit (I 2 C) bus is a multi-host serial data communication bus. Devices communicate in a host/client environment where the host devices initiate the communication. A client device is controlled through addressing.

Pulling the line to ground is considered a logical zero and letting the line float is considered a logical one.\nThe following diagram shows a typical connection between two processors configured as host and client devices.\nFigure 28-11. I 2 C Host/Client Connection\nThe I 2 C bus can operate with one or more host devices and one or more client devices.\nThere are four potential modes of operation for a given device:\n\u00b7 Host Transmit mode (host is transmitting data to a client)\n\u00b7 Host Receive mode (host is receiving data from a client)\nRev. 30-000020A\n4/3/2017\n\u00b7 Client Transmit mode (client is transmitting data to a host)\n\u00b7 Client Receive mode (client is receiving data from the host)",
    "Figure 28-10. MSSP Block Diagram (I 2 C Client Mode)\nTo begin communication, a host device starts out in Host Transmit mode. The host device sends out a Start bit followed by the address byte of the client it intends to communicate with. This is followed by a single Read/Write bit, which determines whether the host intends to transmit to or receive data from the client device.\nIf the requested client exists on the bus, it will respond with an Acknowledge bit, otherwise known as an ACK. The host then continues in either Transmit mode or Receive mode and the client continues in the complement, either in Receive mode or Transmit mode, respectively.\nA Start bit is indicated by a high-to-low transition of the SDA line while the SCL line is held high. Address and data bytes are sent out, Most Significant bit (MSb) first. The Read/Write bit is sent out as a logical one when the host intends to read data from the client, and is sent out as a logical zero when it intends to write data to the client.",
    "Figure 28-10. MSSP Block Diagram (I 2 C Client Mode)\nThe Acknowledge (ACK) bit is an active-low signal, which holds the SDA line low to indicate to the transmitter that the client device has received the transmitted data and is ready to receive more.\nThe transition of a data bit is always performed while the SCL line is held low. Transitions that occur while the SCL line is held high are used to indicate Start and Stop bits.\nIf the host intends to write to the client, then it repeatedly sends out a byte of data, with the client responding after each byte with an ACK bit. In this example, the host device is in Host Transmit mode and the client is in Client Receive mode.\nIf the host intends to read from the client, then it repeatedly receives a byte of data from the client, and responds after each byte with an ACK bit. In this example, the host device is in Host Receive mode and the client is in Client Transmit mode.",
    "Figure 28-10. MSSP Block Diagram (I 2 C Client Mode)\nOn the last byte of data communicated, the host device may end the transmission by sending a Stop bit. If the host device is in Receive mode, it sends the Stop bit in place of the last ACK bit. A Stop bit is indicated by a low-to-high transition of the SDA line while the SCL line is held high.\nIn some cases, the host may want to maintain control of the bus and re-initiate another transmission. If so, the host device may send another Start bit in place of the Stop bit or last ACK bit when it is in Receive mode.\nThe I 2 C bus specifies three message protocols:\n\u00b7 Single message where a host writes data to a client\n\u00b7 Single message where a host reads data from a client\n\u00b7 Combined message where a host initiates a minimum of two writes, or two reads, or a combination of writes and reads, to one or more clients",
    "Figure 28-10. MSSP Block Diagram (I 2 C Client Mode)\nWhen one device is transmitting a logical one, or letting the line float, and a second device is transmitting a logical zero, or holding the line low, the first device can detect that the line is not a logical one. This detection, when used on the SCL line, is called clock stretching. Clock stretching gives client devices a mechanism to control the flow of data. When this detection is used on the SDA line, it is called arbitration. Arbitration ensures that there is only one host device communicating at any single time.",

In receive operations, SSPSR and SSPxBUF together create a double-buffered receiver. When SSPSR receives a complete byte, it is transferred to SSPxBUF and the SSPxIF interrupt is set.

    "28.4.1 Clock Stretching\nWhen a client device has not completed processing data, it can delay the transfer of more data through the process of clock stretching. An addressed client device may hold the SCL clock line low after receiving or sending a bit, indicating that it is not yet ready to continue. The host that is communicating with the client will attempt to raise the SCL line to transfer the next bit, but will detect that the clock line has not yet been released. Because the SCL connection is open-drain, the client has the ability to hold that line low until it is ready to continue communicating.\nClock stretching allows receivers that cannot keep up with a transmitter to control the flow of incoming data.",
    "28.4.2 Arbitration\nEach host device must monitor the bus for Start and Stop bits. If the device detects that the bus is busy, it cannot begin a new message until the bus returns to an Idle state.\nHowever, two host devices may try to initiate a transmission on or about the same time. When this occurs, the process of arbitration begins. Each transmitter checks the level of the SDA data line and compares it to the level that it expects to find. The first transmitter to observe that the two levels do not match loses arbitration, and must stop transmitting on the SDA line.\nFor example, if one transmitter holds the SDA line to a logical one (lets it float) and a second transmitter holds it to a logical zero (pulls it low), the result is that the SDA line will be low. The first transmitter then observes that the level of the line is different than expected and concludes that another transmitter is communicating.",
    "28.4.2 Arbitration\nThe first transmitter to notice this difference is the one that loses arbitration and must stop driving the SDA line. If this transmitter is also a host device, it also must stop driving the SCL line. Then, it can monitor the lines for a Stop condition before trying to reissue its transmission. In the meantime, the other device that has not noticed any difference between the expected and actual levels on the\nSDA line continues with its original transmission. It can do so without any complications, because so far, the transmission appears exactly as expected with no other transmitter disturbing the message.\nClient Transmit mode can also be arbitrated, when a host addresses multiple clients, but this is less common.\nIf two host devices are sending a message to two different client devices at the address stage, the host sending the lower client address always wins arbitration. When two host devices send messages to the same client address, and addresses can sometimes refer to multiple clients, the arbitration process must continue into the data stage.\nArbitration usually occurs very rarely, but it is a necessary process for proper multi-host support.",
    "28.4.3 Byte Format\nAll communication in I 2 C is done in 9-bit segments. A byte is sent from a host to a client or vice versa, followed by an Acknowledge bit sent back.

EUSART - Enhanced Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter\nThe Enhanced Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (EUSART) module is a serial I/O communications peripheral. It contains all the clock generators, Shift registers and data buffers necessary to perform an input or output serial data transfer independent of device program execution. The EUSART, also known as a Serial Communications Interface (SCI), can be configured as a full-duplex asynchronous system or half-duplex synchronous system. Full-Duplex mode is useful for communications with peripheral systems, such as CRT terminals and personal computers. Half-Duplex Synchronous mode is intended for communications with peripheral devices, such as A/D or D/A integrated circuits, serial EEPROMs, or other microcontrollers. These devices typically do not have internal clocks for baud rate generation and require the external clock signal provided by a host synchronous device.\nThe EUSART module includes the following capabilities:",

    "29.1 EUSART Asynchronous Mode\nThe EUSART transmits and receives data using the standard non-return-to-zero (NRZ) format. NRZ is implemented with two levels: a V OH Mark state which represents a ' 1 ' data bit, and a V OL Space state which represents a ' 0 ' data bit. NRZ refers to the fact that consecutively transmitted data bits of the same value stay at the output level of that bit without returning to a neutral level between each bit transmission. An NRZ transmission port idles in the Mark state. Each character transmission consists of one Start bit followed by eight or nine data bits and is always terminated by one or more Stop bits. The Start bit is always a space and the Stop bits are always marks. The most common data format is eight bits. Each transmitted bit persists for a period of 1/(Baud Rate). An on-chip dedicated 8-bit/16-bit Baud Rate Generator is used to derive standard baud rate frequencies from the system oscillator. See Table 29-2 for examples of baud rate configurations.",
    "29.1 EUSART Asynchronous Mode\nThe EUSART transmits and receives the LSb first. The EUSART's transmitter and receiver are functionally independent, but share the same data format and baud rate. Parity is not supported by the hardware, but can be implemented in software and stored as the ninth data bit.",
    "29.1.1 EUSART Asynchronous Transmitter\nFigure 29-1 is a simplified representation of the transmitter. The heart of the transmitter is the serial Transmit Shift Register (TSR), which is not directly accessible by software. The TSR obtains its data from the transmit buffer, which is the TXxREG register.",
    "29.1.1.1 Enabling the Transmitter\nThe EUSART transmitter is enabled for asynchronous operations by configuring the following three control bits:\n- \u00b7 The TXEN bit in the TXxSTA register is set to ' 1 ' to enable the transmitter circuitry of the EUSART\n\u00b7 The SYNC bit in the TXxSTA register is set to ' 0 ' to configure the EUSART for asynchronous operation\n\u00b7 The SPEN bit in the RCxSTA register is set to ' 1 ' to enable the EUSART interface and to enable automatically the output drivers for RxyPPS selected as the TXx/CKx output\nAll other EUSART control bits are assumed to be in their default state.\nIf the TXx/CKx pin is shared with an analog peripheral, the analog I/O function must be disabled by clearing the corresponding ANSEL bit.\nImportant: The TXxIF Transmitter Interrupt flag in the PIR3 register is set when the TXEN enable bit in the PIE3 register is set and the Transmit Shift Register (TSR) is Idle.",
    "29.1.1.2 Transmitting Data\nA transmission is initiated by writing a character to the TXxREG register. If this is the first character, or the previous character has been completely flushed from the TSR, the data in the TXxREG is immediately transferred to the TSR register. If the TSR still contains all or part of a previous character, the new character data is held in the TXxREG until the Stop bit of the previous character has been transmitted. The pending character in the TXxREG is then transferred to the TSR in one TCY immediately following the Stop bit transmission. The transmission of the Start bit, data bits and Stop bit sequence commences immediately following the transfer of the data to the TSR from the TXxREG.",
    "29.1.1.3 Transmit Data Polarity\nThe polarity of the transmit data can be controlled with the SCKP bit of the BAUDxCON register. The default state of this bit is ' 0 ' which selects high true transmit idle and data bits. Setting the SCKP bit to ' 1 ' will invert the transmit data resulting in low true idle and data bits. The SCKP bit controls transmit data polarity in Asynchronous mode only. In Synchronous mode, the SCKP bit has a different function. See the Clock Polarity section for more details.",
    "29.1.1.4 Transmit Interrupt Flag\nThe TXxIF interrupt flag bit of the PIR3 register is set whenever the EUSART transmitter is enabled and no character is being held for transmission in the TXxREG. In other words, the TXxIF bit is only cleared when the TSR is busy with a character and a new character has been queued for transmission in the TXxREG. The TXxIF flag bit is not cleared immediately upon writing TXxREG. TXxIF becomes valid in the second instruction cycle following the write execution. Polling TXxIF immediately following the TXxREG write will return invalid results. The TXxIF bit is read-only, it cannot be set or cleared by software.\nThe TXxIF interrupt can be enabled by setting the TXxIE interrupt enable bit of the PIE3 register. However, the TXxIF flag bit will be set whenever the TXxREG is empty, regardless of the state of TXxIE enable bit.\nTo use interrupts when transmitting data, set the TXxIE bit only when there is more data to send. Clear the TXxIE interrupt enable bit upon writing the last character of the transmission to the TXxREG.",
    "29.1.1.5 TSR Status\nThe TRMT bit of the TXxSTA register indicates the status of the TSR register. This is a read-only bit. The TRMT bit is set when the TSR register is empty and is cleared when a character is transferred to the TSR register from the TXxREG. The TRMT bit remains clear until all bits have been shifted out of the TSR register. No interrupt logic is tied to this bit, so the user needs to poll this bit to determine the TSR status.\nImportant: The TSR register is not mapped in data memory, so it is not available to the user.",
    "29.1.1.6 Transmitting 9-Bit Characters\nThe EUSART supports 9-bit character transmissions. When the TX9 bit of the TXxSTA register is set, the EUSART will shift nine bits out for each character transmitted. The TX9D bit of the TXxSTA register is the ninth, and Most Significant data bit. When transmitting 9-bit data, the TX9D data bit must be written before writing the eight Least Significant bits into the TXxREG. All nine bits of data will be transferred to the Transmit Shift Register (TSR) immediately after TXxREG is written.\nA special 9-bit Address mode is available for use with multiple receivers. See Address Detection for more information on the Address mode.",

Select the transmit output pin by writing the appropriate value to the RxyPPS register.\n3. Enable the asynchronous serial port by clearing the SYNC bit and setting the SPEN bit.\n4. If 9-bit transmission is desired, set the TX9 control bit in the TXxSTA register. That will indicate that the eight Least Significant data bits are an address when the receiver is set for address detection.\n5. Set the SCKP bit if inverted transmit is desired.\n6. Enable the transmission by setting the TXEN control bit. This will cause the TXxIF interrupt bit to be set.\n7. If interrupts are desired, set the TXxIE interrupt enable bit of the PIE3 register.\n8. An interrupt will occur immediately provided that the GIE and PEIE bits of the INTCON register are also set.",

    "29.1.2 EUSART Asynchronous Receiver\nThe Asynchronous mode is typically used in RS-232 systems. A simplified representation of the receiver is shown in the Figure 29-2. The data is received on the RXx/DTx pin and drives the data recovery block. The data recovery block is actually a high-speed shifter operating at 16 times the baud rate, whereas the serial Receive Shift Register (RSR) operates at the bit rate. When all eight or nine bits of the character have been shifted in, they are immediately transferred to a two character First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory. The FIFO buffering allows reception of two complete characters and the start of a third character before software must start servicing the EUSART receiver. The FIFO and RSR registers are not directly accessible by software. Access to the received data is via the RCxREG register.",
    "29.1.2.1 Enabling the Receiver\nThe EUSART receiver is enabled for asynchronous operation by configuring the following three control bits:\n\u00b7 CREN bit in the RCxSTA register is set to ' 1 ' to enables the receiver circuitry of the EUSART\n\u00b7 SYNC bit in the TXxSTA register is set to ' 0 ' to configure the EUSART for asynchronous operation\n\u00b7 SPEN bit in the RCxSTA register is set to ' 1 ' to enable the EUSART interface\nAll other EUSART control bits are assumed to be in their default state.\nThe user must set the RXxPPS register to select the RXx/DTx I/O pin and set the corresponding TRIS bit to configure the pin as an input.\nImportant: If the RX/DT function is on an analog pin, the corresponding ANSEL bit must be cleared for the receiver to function.",
    "29.1.2.2 Receiving Data\nThe receiver data recovery circuit initiates character reception on the falling edge of the first bit. The first bit, also known as the Start bit, is always a zero. The data recovery circuit counts one-half bit time to the center of the Start bit and verifies that the bit is still a zero. If it is not a zero, then the data recovery circuit aborts character reception, without generating an error, and resumes looking for the falling edge of the Start bit. If the Start bit zero verification succeeds, then the data recovery circuit counts a full bit time to the center of the next bit. The bit is then sampled by a majority detect circuit and the resulting ' 0 ' or ' 1 ' is shifted into the RSR. This repeats until all data bits have been sampled and shifted into the RSR. One final bit time is measured and the level sampled. This is the Stop bit, which is always a ' 1 '. If the data recovery circuit samples a ' 0 ' in the Stop bit position, then a\nframing error is set for this character, otherwise the framing error is cleared for this character. See Receive Framing Error for more information on framing errors.",
    "29.1.2.2 Receiving Data\nImmediately after all data bits and the Stop bit have been received, the character in the RSR is transferred to the EUSART receive FIFO, and the RCxIF interrupt flag bit of the PIR3 register is set. The top character in the FIFO is transferred out of the FIFO by reading the RCxREG register.\nImportant: If the receive FIFO is overrun, no additional characters will be received until the Overrun condition is cleared. See Receive Overrun Error for more information.",
    "29.1.2.3 Receive Interrupts\nThe RCxIF interrupt flag bit of the PIR3 register is set whenever the EUSART receiver is enabled and there is an unread character in the receive FIFO. The RCxIF interrupt flag bit is read-only, it cannot be set or cleared by software.\nRCxIF interrupts are enabled by setting all of the following bits:\n\u00b7 RCxIE, Interrupt Enable bit of the PIE3 register\n\u00b7 PEIE, Peripheral Interrupt Enable bit of the INTCON register\n\u00b7 GIE, Global Interrupt Enable bit of the INTCON register\nThe RCxIF interrupt flag bit will be set when there is an unread character in the FIFO, regardless of the state of interrupt enable bits.",
    "29.1.2.4 Receive Framing Error\nEach character in the receive FIFO buffer has a corresponding framing error Status bit. A framing error indicates that a Stop bit was not seen at the expected time. The framing error status is accessed via the FERR bit of the RCxSTA register. The FERR bit represents the status of the top unread character in the receive FIFO. Therefore, the FERR bit must be read before reading the RCxREG.\nThe FERR bit is read-only and only applies to the top unread character in the receive FIFO. A framing error (FERR = 1 ) does not preclude reception of additional characters. It is not necessary to clear the FERR bit. Reading the next character from the FIFO buffer will advance the FIFO to the next character and the next corresponding framing error.\nThe FERR bit can be forced clear by clearing the SPEN bit of the RCxSTA register which resets the EUSART. Clearing the CREN bit of the RCxSTA register does not affect the FERR bit. A framing error by itself does not generate an interrupt.",
    "29.1.2.4 Receive Framing Error\nImportant: If all receive characters in the receive FIFO have framing errors, repeated reads of the RCxREG will not clear the FERR bit.",
    "29.1.2.5 Receive Overrun Error\nThe receive FIFO buffer can hold two characters. An overrun error will be generated if a third character, in its entirety, is received before the FIFO is accessed. When this happens the OERR bit of the RCxSTA register is set. The characters already in the FIFO buffer can be read but no additional characters will be received until the error is cleared. The error must be cleared by either clearing the CREN bit of the RCxSTA register or by resetting the EUSART by clearing the SPEN bit of the RCxSTA register.",
    "29.1.2.6 Receiving 9-Bit Characters\nThe EUSART supports 9-bit character reception. When the RX9 bit of the RCxSTA register is set the EUSART will shift nine bits into the RSR for each character received. The RX9D bit of the RCxSTA\nregister is the ninth and Most Significant data bit of the top unread character in the receive FIFO.

    "29.1.2.7 Address Detection\nA special Address Detection mode is available for use when multiple receivers share the same transmission line, such as in RS-485 systems. Address detection is enabled by setting the ADDEN bit of the RCxSTA register.\nAddress detection requires 9-bit character reception. When address detection is enabled, only characters with the ninth data bit set will be transferred to the receive FIFO buffer, thereby setting the RCxIF interrupt bit. All other characters will be ignored.\nUpon receiving an address character, user software determines if the address matches its own. Upon address match, user software must disable address detection by clearing the ADDEN bit before the next Stop bit occurs. When user software detects the end of the message, determined by the message protocol used, software places the receiver back into the Address Detection mode by setting the ADDEN bit.",

    "29.1.3 Clock Accuracy with Asynchronous Operation\nThe factory calibrates the internal oscillator block output (INTOSC). However, the INTOSC frequency may drift as V DD or temperature changes, and this directly affects the asynchronous baud rate. Two methods may be used to adjust the baud rate clock, but both require a reference clock source of some kind.\nThe first (preferred) method uses the OSCTUNE register to adjust the INTOSC output. Adjusting the value in the OSCTUNE register allows for fine resolution changes to the system clock source.\nThe other method adjusts the value in the Baud Rate Generator. This can be done automatically with the Auto-Baud Detect feature (see Auto-Baud Detect). There may not be fine enough resolution when adjusting the Baud Rate Generator to compensate for a gradual change in the peripheral clock frequency.",
    "29.2 EUSART Baud Rate Generator (BRG)\nThe Baud Rate Generator (BRG) is an 8-bit or 16-bit timer that is dedicated to the support of both the asynchronous and synchronous EUSART operation. By default, the BRG operates in 8-bit mode. Setting the BRG16 bit of the BAUDxCON register selects the 16-bit mode.\nThe SPxBRGH, SPxBRGL register pair determines the period of the free-running baud rate timer. In Asynchronous mode, the multiplier of the baud rate period is determined by both the BRGH bit of the TXxSTA register and the BRG16 bit of the BAUDxCON register. In Synchronous mode, the BRGH bit is ignored.\nTable 29-1 contains the formulas for determining the baud rate. Equation 29-1 provides a sample calculation for determining the baud rate and baud rate error.",
    "29.2 EUSART Baud Rate Generator (BRG)\nTypical baud rates and error values for various Asynchronous modes have been computed and are shown in Table 29-2. It may be advantageous to use the high baud rate (BRGH = 1 ) or the 16-bit BRG (BRG16 = 1 ) to reduce the baud rate error. The 16-bit BRG mode is used to achieve slow baud rates for fast oscillator frequencies. The BRGH bit is used to achieve very high baud rates.\nWriting a new value to the SPxBRGH, SPxBRGL register pair causes the BRG timer to be reset (or cleared). This ensures that the BRG does not wait for a timer overflow before outputting the new baud rate.\nIf the system clock is changed during an active receive operation, a receive error or data loss may result. To avoid this problem, check the status of the RCIDL bit to make sure that the receive operation is idle before changing the system clock.",

Rather than the BRG clocking the incoming RX signal, the RX signal is timing the BRG. The Baud Rate Generator is used to time the period of a received 55h (ASCII 'U') which is the Sync character for the LIN bus. The unique feature of this character is that it has five rising edges including the Stop bit edge.",
    "29.2.1 Auto-Baud Detect\nSetting the ABDEN bit of the BAUDxCON register starts the auto-baud calibration sequence. While the ABD sequence takes place, the EUSART state machine is held in Idle. On the first rising edge of the receive line, after the Start bit, the SPxBRG begins counting up using the BRG counter clock as shown in Figure 29-6. The fifth rising edge will occur on the RXx pin at the end of the eighth bit period. At that time, an accumulated value totaling the proper BRG period is left in the SPxBRGH, SPxBRGL register pair, the ABDEN bit is automatically cleared, and the RCxIF interrupt flag is set. The value in RCxREG needs to be read to clear the RCxIF interrupt. RCxREG content may be discarded. When calibrating for modes that do not use the SPxBRGH register, the user can verify that the SPxBRGL register did not overflow by checking for 00h in the SPxBRGH register.",

During ABD, both the SPxBRGH and SPxBRGL registers are used as a 16-bit counter, independent of the BRG16 bit setting. While calibrating the baud rate period, the SPxBRGH and SPxBRGL registers are clocked at 1/8 th  the BRG base clock rate. The resulting byte measurement is the average bit time when clocked at full speed.",

    "29.2.3 Auto-Wake-up on Break\nDuring Sleep mode, all clocks to the EUSART are suspended. Because of this, the Baud Rate Generator is inactive and a proper character reception cannot be performed. The Auto-Wake-up feature allows the controller to wake up due to activity on the RX/DT line. This feature is available only in Asynchronous mode.\nThe Auto-Wake-up feature is enabled by setting the WUE bit of the BAUDxCON register. Once set, the normal receive sequence on RX/DT is disabled, and the EUSART remains in an Idle state, monitoring for a wake-up event independent of the CPU mode. A wake-up event consists of a high-to-low transition on the RX/DT line. (This coincides with the start of a Sync Break or a wake-up signal character for the LIN protocol.)",
    "29.2.3 Auto-Wake-up on Break\nThe EUSART module generates an RCxIF interrupt coincident with the wake-up event. The interrupt is generated synchronously to the Q clocks in normal CPU operating modes as shown in Figure 29-7, and asynchronously if the device is in Sleep mode, as shown in Figure 29-8. The Interrupt condition is cleared by reading the RCxREG register.\nThe WUE bit is automatically cleared by the low-to-high transition on the RX line at the end of the Break. This signals to the user that the Break event is over. At this point, the EUSART module is in Idle mode waiting to receive the next character.",
    "Break Character\nTo avoid character errors or character fragments during a wake-up event, the wake-up character must be all zeros.\nWhen the wake-up is enabled, the function works independent of the low time on the data stream. If the WUE bit is set and a valid nonzero character is received, the low time from the Start bit to the first rising edge will be interpreted as the wake-up event. The remaining bits in the character will be received as a fragmented character and subsequent characters can result in framing or overrun errors.\nTherefore, the initial character in the transmission must be all ' 0 's. This must be ten or more bit times, 13-bit times recommended for LIN bus, or any number of bit times for standard RS-232 devices.",
    "Oscillator Start-up Time\nOscillator start-up time must be considered, especially in applications using oscillators with longer start-up intervals (i.e., LP, XT or HS/PLL mode). The Sync Break (or wake-up signal) character must be of sufficient length, and be followed by a sufficient interval, to allow enough time for the selected oscillator to start and provide proper initialization of the EUSART.",
    "WUE Bit\nThe wake-up event causes a receive interrupt by setting the RCxIF bit. The WUE bit is cleared in hardware by a rising edge on RX/DT. The Interrupt condition is then cleared in software by reading the RCxREG register and discarding its contents.\nTo ensure that no actual data is lost, check the RCIDL bit to verify that a receive operation is not in process before setting the WUE bit. If a receive operation is not occurring, the WUE bit may then be set just prior to entering the Sleep mode.",

    "29.2.4 Break Character Sequence\nThe EUSART module has the capability of sending the special Break character sequences that are required by the LIN bus standard. A Break character consists of a Start bit, followed by 12 ' 0 ' bits and a Stop bit.\nTo send a Break character, set the SENDB and TXEN bits of the TXxSTA register. The Break character transmission is then initiated by a write to the TXxREG. The value of data written to TXxREG will be ignored and all ' 0 's will be transmitted.\nThe SENDB bit is automatically reset by hardware after the corresponding Stop bit is sent. This allows the user to preload the transmit FIFO with the next transmit byte following the Break character (typically, the Sync character in the LIN specification).\nThe TRMT bit of the TXxSTA register indicates when the transmit operation is active or idle, just as it does during normal transmission. See Figure 29-9 for more details.",

Load TXxREG with a dummy character to initiate transmission (the value is ignored).\n4. Write '55h' to TXxREG to load the Sync character into the transmit FIFO buffer.\n5. After the Break has been sent, the SENDB bit is reset by hardware and the Sync character is then transmitted.\nWhen TXxREG becomes empty, as indicated by TXxIF, the next data byte can be written to TXxREG.",
    "29.2.5 Receiving a Break Character\nThe EUSART module can receive a Break character in two ways.\nThe first method to detect a Break character uses the FERR bit of the RCxSTA register and the received data as indicated by RCxREG. The Baud Rate Generator is assumed to have been initialized to the expected baud rate.\nA Break character has been received when all three of the following conditions are true:\n\u00b7 The RCxIF bit is set\n\u00b7 The FERR bit is set\n- \u00b7 RCxREG = 00h\nThe second method uses the Auto-Wake-up feature described in Auto-Wake-up on Break. By enabling this feature, the EUSART will sample the next two transitions on RX/DT, cause an RCxIF interrupt, and receive the next data byte followed by another interrupt.\nNote that following a Break character, the user will typically want to enable the Auto-Baud Detect feature. For both methods, the user can set the ABDEN bit of the BAUDxCON register before placing the EUSART in Sleep mode.\nFigure 29-9. Send Break Character Sequence",
    "29.3 EUSART Synchronous Mode\nSynchronous serial communications are typically used in systems with a single host and one or more clients. The host device contains the necessary circuitry for baud rate generation and supplies the clock for all devices in the system. Client devices can take advantage of the host clock by eliminating the internal clock generation circuitry.\nThere are two signal lines in Synchronous mode: A bidirectional data line and a clock line. The clients use the external clock supplied by the host to shift the serial data into and out of their respective Receive and Transmit Shift Registers. Since the data line is bidirectional, synchronous operation is half-duplex only. Half-duplex refers to the fact that host and client devices can receive and transmit data, but not both simultaneously. The EUSART can operate as either a host or client device.\nStart and Stop bits are not used in synchronous transmissions.",

The TXx/CKx pin output driver is automatically enabled when the EUSART is configured for synchronous transmit or receive operation. Serial data bits change on the leading edge to ensure they are valid at the trailing edge of each clock. One clock cycle is generated for each data bit. Only as many clock cycles are generated as there are data bits.",
    "29.3.1.2 Clock Polarity\nA clock polarity option is provided for Microwire compatibility. Clock polarity is selected with the SCKP bit of the BAUDxCON register. Setting the SCKP bit sets the clock Idle state as high. When the SCKP bit is set, the data changes on the falling edge of each clock. Clearing the SCKP bit sets the Idle state as low. When the SCKP bit is cleared, the data changes on the rising edge of each clock.",

If the TSR still contains all or part of a previous character, the new character data is held in the TXxREG until the last bit of the previous character has been transmitted. If this is the first character, or the previous character has been completely flushed from the TSR, the data in the TXxREG is immediately transferred to the TSR. The transmission of the character commences immediately following the transfer of the data to the TSR from the TXxREG.\nEach data bit changes on the leading edge of the host clock and remains valid until the subsequent leading clock edge.\nNote: The TSR register is not mapped in data memory, so it is not available to the user.",

    "29.3.1.5 Synchronous Host Reception\nData is received at the RXx/DTx pin. The RXx/DTx pin output driver is automatically disabled when the EUSART is configured for synchronous host receive operation.\nIn Synchronous mode, reception is enabled by setting either the Single Receive Enable bit (SREN of the RCxSTA register) or the Continuous Receive Enable bit (CREN of the RCxSTA register).\nWhen SREN is set and CREN is clear, only as many clock cycles are generated as there are data bits in a single character. The SREN bit is automatically cleared at the completion of one character. When CREN is set, clocks are continuously generated until CREN is cleared. If CREN is cleared in the middle of a character, the CK clock stops immediately and the partial character is discarded. If SREN and CREN are both set, then SREN is cleared at the completion of the first character and CREN takes precedence.",
    "29.3.1.5 Synchronous Host Reception\nTo initiate reception, set either SREN or CREN. Data is sampled at the RXx/DTx pin on the trailing edge of the TX/CK clock pin and is shifted into the Receive Shift Register (RSR). When a complete character is received into the RSR, the RCxIF bit is set and the character is automatically transferred to the two character receive FIFO. The Least Significant eight bits of the top character in the receive FIFO are available in RCxREG. The RCxIF bit remains set as long as there are unread characters in the receive FIFO.\nNote: If the RX/DT function is on an analog pin, the corresponding ANSEL bit must be cleared for the receiver to function.",
    "29.3.1.6 Receive Overrun Error\nThe receive FIFO buffer can hold two characters. An overrun error will be generated if a third character, in its entirety, is received before RCxREG is read to access the FIFO. When this happens, the OERR bit of the RCxSTA register is set. Previous data in the FIFO will not be overwritten. The two characters in the FIFO buffer can be read; however, no additional characters will be received until the error is cleared. The OERR bit can only be cleared by clearing the Overrun condition. If the overrun error occurred when the SREN bit is set and CREN is clear, then the error is cleared by reading RCxREG. If the overrun occurred when the CREN bit is set, then the Error condition is cleared by either clearing the CREN bit of the RCxSTA register or by clearing the SPEN bit, which resets the EUSART.",
    "29.3.1.7 Receiving 9-Bit Characters\nThe EUSART supports 9-bit character reception. When the RX9 bit of the RCxSTA register is set the EUSART will shift nine bits into the RSR for each character received. The RX9D bit of the RCxSTA register is the ninth, and Most Significant, data bit of the top unread character in the receive FIFO. When reading 9-bit data from the receive FIFO buffer, the RX9D data bit must be read before reading the eight Least Significant bits from the RCxREG.",

    "31. Temperature Indicator Module\nThis family of devices is equipped with a temperature circuit designed to measure the operating temperature of the silicon die. The circuit's range of operating temperature falls between -40\u00b0C and +85\u00b0C. The output is a voltage that is proportional to the device temperature. The output of the temperature indicator is internally connected to the device ADC.\nThe circuit may be used as a temperature threshold detector or a more accurate temperature indicator, depending on the level of calibration performed. A one-point calibration allows the circuit to indicate a temperature closely surrounding that point. A two-point calibration allows the circuit to sense the entire range of temperature more accurately. Refer to Application Note AN1333, 'Use and Calibration of the Internal Temperature Indicator' (DS00001333) for more details regarding the calibration process.",
    "31.1 Circuit Operation\nFigure 31-1 shows a simplified block diagram of the temperature circuit. The proportional voltage output is achieved by measuring the forward voltage drop across multiple silicon junctions.\nThe following equation describes the output characteristics of the temperature indicator.\nEquation 31-1. VOUT Ranges\nHig\u210e Range: V\nOUT DD T\n= V\n-4V\nThe temperature sense circuit is integrated with the Fixed Voltage Reference (FVR) module. See 'FVR - Fixed Voltage Reference' chapter for more information.\nLow Range: V\nOUT = V DD -2V T\nThe circuit is enabled by setting the TSEN bit of the FVRCON register. When disabled, the circuit draws no current.\nThe circuit operates in either high or low range. The high range, selected by setting the TSRNG bit of the FVRCON register, provides a wider output voltage. This provides more resolution over the temperature range, but may be less consistent from part to part. This range requires a higher bias voltage to operate and thus, a higher V DD is needed.",
    "31.1 Circuit Operation\nThe low range is selected by clearing the TSRNG bit of the FVRCON register. The low range generates a lower voltage drop and thus, a lower bias voltage is needed to operate the circuit. The low range is provided for low-voltage operation.\nFigure 31-1. Temperature Circuit Diagram",
    "Related Links\nFVR - Fixed Voltage Reference",
    "31.2 Minimum Operating VDD\nWhen the temperature circuit is operated in low range, the device may be operated at any operating voltage that is within specifications.\nWhen the temperature circuit is operated in high range, the device operating voltage, V DD, must be high enough to ensure that the temperature circuit is correctly biased.\nTable 31-1 shows the recommended minimum VDD vs. range setting.\nTable 31-1. Recommended VDD vs. Range\n\n3.6V, Min. V DD , TSRNG = 0 = 1.8V",
    "31.3 Temperature Output\nThe output of the circuit is measured using the internal Analog-to-Digital Converter. A channel is reserved for the temperature circuit output. Refer to the ' ADCC - Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation Module ' chapter for detailed information.",
    "Related Links\nADCC - Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation Module",
    "31.4 ADC Acquisition Time\nTo ensure accurate temperature measurements, the user must wait at least 200 \u03bcs after the ADC input multiplexer is connected to the temperature indicator output before the conversion is performed.

    "33.3 ADC Acquisition Requirements\nFor the ADC to meet its specified accuracy, the charge holding capacitor (C HOLD) must be allowed to fully charge to the input channel voltage level. The analog input model is shown in Figure 33-4. The source impedance (RS) and the internal sampling switch (RSS) impedance directly affect the time required to charge the capacitor CHOLD. The sampling switch (RSS) impedance varies over the device voltage (V DD), refer to Figure 33-4. The maximum recommended impedance for analog sources is 10 k\u03a9. As the source impedance is decreased, the acquisition time may be decreased. After the analog input channel is selected (or changed), an ADC acquisition must be completed before the conversion can be started. To calculate the minimum acquisition time, Equation 33-1 may be used. This equation assumes that 1/2 LSb error is used (1024 steps for the ADC).

    "33.4 Capacitive Voltage Divider (CVD) Features\nThe ADC module contains several features that allow the user to perform a relative capacitance measurement on any ADC channel using the internal ADC Sample-and-Hold capacitance as a reference. This relative capacitance measurement can be used to implement capacitive touch or proximity sensing applications. The following figure shows the basic block diagram of the CVD portion of the ADC module.\nFigure 33-6. Hardware Capacitive Voltage Divider Block Diagram",
    "33.4.1 CVD Operation\nA CVD operation begins with the ADC's internal Sample-and-Hold capacitor (CHOLD) being disconnected from the path which connects it to the external capacitive sensor node. While disconnected, CHOLD is precharged to VDD or VSS the sensor node is also charged to VSS or V DD, respectively to the level opposite that of C HOLD. When the precharge phase is complete, the VDD/VSS bias paths for the two nodes are shut off and the paths between CHOLD and the external sensor node is reconnected, at which time the acquisition phase of the CVD operation begins. During acquisition, a capacitive voltage divider is formed between the precharged C HOLD and sensor nodes, which results in a final voltage level setting on C HOLD which is determined by the capacitances and precharge levels of the two nodes. After acquisition, the ADC converts the voltage level on C HOLD. This process is then repeated with the selected precharge levels inverted for both the C HOLD and the sensor nodes. The waveform for two CVD measurements, which is known as differential CVD measurement, is shown in the following figure.",
    "Figure 33-7. Differential CVD Measurement Waveform\nTime",
    "33.4.2 Precharge Control\nThe Precharge stage is an optional period of time that brings the external channel and internal Sample-and-Hold capacitor to known voltage levels. Precharge is enabled by writing a nonzero value to the ADPRE register. This stage is initiated when an ADC conversion begins, either from setting the ADGO bit, a Special Event Trigger, or a conversion restart from the computation functionality. If the ADPRE register is cleared when an ADC conversion begins, this stage is skipped.",
    "33.4.2 Precharge Control\nDuring the precharge time, CHOLD is disconnected from the outer portion of the sample path that leads to the external capacitive sensor and is connected to either V DD or V SS , depending on the value of the ADPPOL bit. At the same time, the port pin logic of the selected analog channel is overridden to drive a digital high or low out, in order to precharge the outer portion of the ADC's sample path, which includes the external sensor. The output polarity of this override is also determined by the ADPPOL bit such that the external sensor cap is charged opposite that of the internal C HOLD cap. The amount of time that this charging needs is controlled by the ADPRE register.\nImportant: The external charging overrides the TRIS setting of the respective I/O pin. If there is a device attached to this pin, precharge must not be used.",
    "33.4.3 Acquisition Control for CVD (ADPRE > 0 )\nThe Acquisition stage allows time for the voltage on the internal Sample-and-Hold capacitor to charge or discharge from the selected analog channel. This acquisition time is controlled by the\nADACQ register. When ADPRE = 0 , acquisition starts at the beginning of conversion. When ADPRE > 0 , the acquisition stage begins when precharge ends.\nAt the start of the acquisition stage, the port pin logic of the selected analog channel is overridden to turn off the digital high/low output drivers so they do not affect the final result of the charge averaging. Also, the selected ADC channel is connected to CHOLD. This allows charge averaging to proceed between the precharged channel and the CHOLD capacitor.\nImportant: When ADPRE > 0 setting ADACQ to ' 0 ' will set a maximum acquisition time (256 ADC clock cycles). When precharge is disabled, setting ADACQ to ' 0 ' will disable hardware acquisition time control.",
    "33.4.4 Guard Ring Outputs\nFigure 33-8 shows a typical guard ring circuit. C GUARD represents the capacitance of the guard ring trace placed on the PCB board. The user selects values for R A and RB that will create a voltage profile on CGUARD, which will match the selected acquisition channel.\nThe purpose of the guard ring is to generate a signal in phase with the CVD sensing signal to minimize the effects of the parasitic capacitance on sensing electrodes. It also can be used as a mutual drive for mutual capacitive sensing. For more information about active guard and mutual drive, see AN1478, 'mTouch TM SensingSolution Acquisition Methods Capacitive Voltage Divider'.\nThe ADC has two guard ring drive outputs, ADGRDA and ADGRDB. These outputs can be routed through PPS controls to I/O pins (see the 'PPS - Peripheral Pin Select Module' chapter for details). The polarity of these outputs are controlled by the ADGPOL and ADIPEN bits.",
    "33.4.4 Guard Ring Outputs\nAt the start of the first precharge stage, both outputs are set to match the ADGPOL bit. Once the acquisition stage begins, ADGRDA changes polarity, while ADGRDB remains unchanged. When performing a double sample conversion, setting the ADIPEN bit causes both guard ring outputs to transition to the opposite polarity of ADGPOL at the start of the second precharge stage, and ADGRDA toggles again for the second acquisition. For more information on the timing of the guard ring output, refer to Figure 33-8 and Figure 33-9.\nFigure 33-8. Guard Ring Circuit\nFigure 33-9.

This register selects a digitally programmable capacitance that is added to the ADC conversion bus, increasing the effective internal capacitance of the Sample-and-Hold capacitor in the ADC module. This is used to improve the match between internal and external capacitance for a better sensing performance. The additional capacitance does not affect analog performance of the ADC because it is not connected during conversion. See Figure 33-11.",

If the accumulated value exceeds 2 (accumulator_width) -1 = 2 16  = 65535, the ADAOV overflow bit is set.\nThe number of samples to be accumulated is determined by the ADRPT (A/D Repeat Setting) register. Each time a sample is added to the accumulator, the ADCNT register is incremented. Once ADRPT samples are accumulated (ADCNT = ADRPT), an accumulator clear command can be issued by the software by setting the ADACLR bit.

See Timer1 Gate for more information. This feature is useful for timing the duration or interval of an analog event.\nIt is recommended that the comparator output be synchronized to the timer by setting the SYNC bit in the CMxCON0 register. This ensures that the timer does not increment while a change in the comparator is occurring. However, synchronization is only possible with the Timer1 clock source. Synchronization with the other odd numbered timers is only possible when they use the same clock source as Timer1.",

If a prescaler is used with Timer1, the comparator output is latched after the prescaling function. To prevent a Race condition, the comparator output is latched onto the falling edge of the Timer1 clock\nsource and Timer1 increments on the rising edge of its clock source.

This period is referred to as the response time. The response time of the comparator differs from the settling time of the voltage reference. Therefore, both of these times must be considered when determining the total response time to a comparator input change.

Since the analog input pins share their connection with a digital input, they have reverse biased ESD protection diodes to V DD and VSS. The analog input, therefore, must be between VSS and VDD. If the input voltage deviates from this range by more than 0.6V in either direction, one of the diodes is forward biased and a latch-up may occur.\nA maximum source impedance of 10 k\u03a9 is recommended for the analog sources. Also, any external component connected to an analog input pin, such as a capacitor or a Zener diode, must have very little leakage current to minimize inaccuracies introduced.\nFigure 34-3.

    "35. HLVD - High/Low-Voltage Detect\nThe HLVD module can be configured to monitor the device voltage. This is useful in battery monitoring applications.\nComplete control of the HLVD module is provided through the HLVDCON0 and HLVDCON1 registers.\nThe module's block diagram is shown in the figure below.\nFigure 35-1. HLVD Module Block Diagram\nSince the HLVD can be software enabled through the HLVDEN bit, setting and clearing the enable bit does not produce a false HLVD event glitch. Each time the HLVD module is enabled, the RDY bit can be used to detect when the module is stable and ready to use.\nThe INTH and INTL bits determine the overall operation of the module. When INTH is set, the module monitors for rises in VDD above the trip point set by the bits. When INTL is set, the module monitors for drops in VDD below the trip point set by the SEL bits. When both the INTH and INTL bits are set, any changes above or below the trip point set by the SEL bits can be monitored.",
    "35. HLVD - High/Low-Voltage Detect\nThe OUT bit can be read to determine if the voltage is greater than or less than the selected trip point.",
    "35.1 Operation\nWhen the HLVD module is enabled, a comparator uses an internally generated voltage reference as the set point. The set point is compared with the trip point, where each node in the resistor divider represents a trip point voltage. The 'trip point' voltage is the voltage level at which the device detects a high or low-voltage event, depending on the configuration of the module.\nWhen the supply voltage is equal to the trip point, the voltage tapped off of the resistor array is equal to the internal reference voltage generated by the voltage reference module. The comparator then generates an interrupt signal by setting the HLVDIF bit.\nThe trip point voltage is software programmable to any of 16 values. The trip point is selected by programming the SEL bits.",
    "35.2 Setup\nTo set up the HLVD module:\n1. Select the desired HLVD trip point by writing the value to the SEL bits of the HLVDCON1 register.\n2. Depending on the application to detect high-voltage peaks or low-voltage drops or both, set the INTH or INTL bit appropriately.\n3. Enable the HLVD module by setting the EN bit.\n4. Clear the HLVD interrupt flag (HLVDIF), which may have been set from a previous interrupt.\n5. If interrupts are desired, enable the HLVD interrupt by setting the HLVDIE and GIE bits. An interrupt will not be generated until the RDY bit is set.\nImportant: Before changing any module settings (interrupts and tripping point), first disable the module (EN = 0 ), make the changes and re-enable the module. This prevents the generation of false HLVD events.",
    "35.3 Current Consumption\nWhen the module is enabled, the HLVD comparator and voltage divider are enabled and consume static current. The total current consumption, when enabled, is specified in electrical specification Parameter D206.\nDepending on the application, the HLVD module does not need to operate constantly. To reduce current consumption, the module can be enabled for short periods where the voltage is checked. After such a check, the module may be disabled.",
    "Related Links\nPower-Down Current (IPD)(1,2)",
    "35.4 HLVD Start-up Time\nIf the HLVD or other circuits using the internal voltage reference are disabled to lower the device's current consumption, the reference voltage circuit will require time to become stable before a low or high-voltage condition can be reliably detected. This start-up time, T FVRST , is an interval that is independent of device clock speed. It is specified in electrical specification.\nThe HLVD interrupt flag is not enabled until T FVRST has expired and a stable reference voltage is reached. For this reason, brief excursions beyond the set point may not be detected during this interval (see the figures below).",

    "35.5 Applications\nIn many applications, it is desirable to detect a drop below, or rise above, a particular voltage threshold. For example, the HLVD module can be periodically enabled to detect Universal Serial Bus (USB) attach or detach. This assumes the device is powered by a lower voltage source than the USB when detached. An attach will indicate a High-Voltage Detect from, for example, 3.3V to 5V (the voltage on USB) and vice versa for a detach. This feature can save a design a few extra components and an attach signal (input pin).\nFor general battery applications, the figure below shows a possible voltage curve. Over time, the device voltage decreases. When the device voltage reaches voltage VA, the HLVD logic generates an interrupt at time T A. The interrupt can cause the execution of an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), which will allow the application to perform 'housekeeping tasks' and a controlled shutdown before the device voltage exits the valid operating range at T B. This will give the application a time window, represented by the difference between TA and TB, to safely exit.",

If the device voltage crosses the trip point, the HLVDIF bit will be set and the device will wake up from Sleep. Device execution will continue from the interrupt vector address if interrupts have been globally enabled.",

    "37. ICSP  - In-Circuit Serial Programming \u2122 \u2122\nICSP programming allows customers to manufacture circuit boards with unprogrammed devices. Programming can be done after the assembly process, allowing the device to be programmed with the most recent firmware or a custom firmware. Five pins are needed for ICSP programming:\n\u00b7 ICSPCLK\n\u00b7 ICSPDAT\n\u00b7 MCLR/VPP\n\u00b7 VDD\n\u00b7 VSS\nIn Program/Verify mode, the program memory, User IDs and the Configuration Words are programmed through serial communications. The ICSPDAT pin is a bidirectional I/O used for transferring the serial data, and the ICSPCLK pin is the clock input. For more information on ICSP, refer to 'Memory Programming Specification' (DS40001772).",
    "37.1 High-Voltage Programming Entry Mode\nThe device is placed into High-Voltage Programming Entry mode by holding the ICSPCLK and ICSPDAT pins low then raising the voltage on MCLR/VPP to VIHH.",
    "37.2 Low-Voltage Programming Entry Mode\nThe Low-Voltage Programming Entry mode allows the PIC  Flash MCUs to be programmed using VDD \u00ae only, without high voltage. When the LVP bit of the Configuration Word 4 register is set to ' 1 ', the low-voltage ICSP programming entry is enabled. To disable the Low-Voltage ICSP mode, the LVP bit must be programmed to ' 0 '.\nEntry into the Low-Voltage Programming Entry mode requires the following steps:\n1. MCLR is brought to VIL.\n2. A 32-bit key sequence is presented on ICSPDAT, while clocking ICSPCLK.\nOnce the key sequence is complete, MCLR must be held at VIL for as long as Program/Verify mode is to be maintained.\nIf low-voltage programming is enabled (LVP = 1 ), the MCLR Reset function is automatically enabled and cannot be disabled. See the 'MCLR' section for more information.\nThe LVP bit can only be reprogrammed to ' 0 ' by using the High-Voltage Programming mode.",

Refer to Figure 37-2.\nFor additional interface recommendations, refer to the specific device programmer manual prior to PCB design.\nIt is recommended that isolation devices be used to separate the programming pins from other circuitry. The type of isolation is highly dependent on the specific application and may include devices such as resistors, diodes, or even jumpers. See Figure 37-3 for more information.\nFigure 37-2.

Instruction Set Summary\nPIC18(L)F65/66K40 devices incorporate the standard set of 75 PIC18 core instructions, as well as an extended set of eight new instructions, for the optimization of code that is recursive or that utilizes a software stack. The extended set is discussed later in this section.",
    "38.1 Standard Instruction Set\nThe standard PIC18 instruction set adds many enhancements to the previous PIC  MCU instruction \u00ae sets, while maintaining an easy migration from these PIC  MCU instruction sets. Most instructions \u00ae are a single program memory word (16 bits), but there are four instructions that require two program memory locations.\nEach single-word instruction is a 16-bit word divided into an opcode, which specifies the instruction type and one or more operands, which further specify the operation of the instruction.\nThe instruction set is highly orthogonal and is grouped into four basic categories:\n\u00b7 Byte-oriented operations\n\u00b7 Bit-oriented operations\n\u00b7 Literal operations\n\u00b7 Control operations\nThe PIC18 instruction set summary in Table 38-2 lists byte-oriented, bit-oriented, literal and control operations. Table 38-1 shows the opcode field descriptions.\nMost byte-oriented instructions have three operands:\n1. The file register (specified by 'f')\n2. The destination of the result (specified by 'd')\n3. The accessed memory (specified by 'a')",
    "38.1 Standard Instruction Set\nThe file register designator 'f' specifies which file register is to be used by the instruction. The destination designator 'd' specifies where the result of the operation is to be placed. If 'd' is zero, the result is placed in the WREG register. If 'd' is one, the result is placed in the file register specified in the instruction.\nAll bit-oriented instructions have three operands:\n1. The file register (specified by 'f')\n2. The bit in the file register (specified by 'b')\n3. The accessed memory (specified by 'a')\nThe bit field designator 'b' selects the number of the bit affected by the operation, while the file register designator 'f' represents the number of the file in which the bit is located.\nThe literal instructions may use some of the following operands:\n\u00b7 A literal value to be loaded into a file register (specified by 'k')\n\u00b7 The desired FSR register to load the literal value into (specified by 'f')\n\u00b7 No operand required (specified by '-')\nThe control instructions may use some of the following operands:",
    "38.1 Standard Instruction Set\n\u00b7 A program memory address (specified by 'n')\n\u00b7 The mode of the CALL or RETURN instructions (specified by 's')\n\u00b7 The mode of the table read and table write instructions (specified by 'm')\n\u00b7 No operand required (specified by '-')\nAll instructions are a single word, except for four double-word instructions. These instructions were made double-word to contain the required information in 32 bits. In the second word, the four MSbs are ' 1 's. If this second word is executed as an instruction (by itself), it will execute as a NOP .\nAll single-word instructions are executed in a single instruction cycle, unless a conditional test is true or the Program Counter is changed as a result of the instruction. In these cases, the execution takes two instruction cycles, with the additional instruction cycle(s) executed as a NOP .\nThe double-word instructions execute in two instruction cycles.",
    "38.1 Standard Instruction Set\nOne instruction cycle consists of four oscillator periods. Thus, for an oscillator frequency of 4 MHz, the normal instruction execution time is 1 \u03bcs. If a conditional test is true, or the Program Counter is changed as a result of an instruction, the instruction execution time is 2 \u03bcs. Two-word branch instructions (if true) would take 3 \u03bcs.\nFigure 38-1 shows the general formats that the instructions can have. All examples use the convention 'nnh' to represent a hexadecimal number.\nThe Instruction Set Summary, shown in Table 38-2, lists the standard instructions recognized by the Microchip Assembler (MPASM TM ).",

    "Notes:\n1. When a PORT register is modified as a function of itself (e.g., MOVF PORTB, 1 0 , ), the value used will be that value present on the pins themselves. For example, if the data latch is ' 1 ' for a pin configured as input and is driven low by an external device, the data will be written back with a ' 0 '.\n2. If this instruction is executed on the TMR0 register (and where applicable, 'd' = 1 ), the prescaler will be cleared if assigned.\n3. If Program Counter (PC) is modified or a conditional test is true, the instruction requires two cycles. The second cycle is executed as a NOP .\n4. Some instructions are two-word instructions. The second word of these instructions will be executed as a NOP unless the first word of the instruction retrieves the information embedded in these 16 bits.

    "38.2 Extended Instruction Set\nIn addition to the standard 75 instructions of the PIC18 instruction set, the PIC18(L)F65/66K40 devices also provide an optional extension to the core CPU functionality. The added features include eight additional instructions that augment Indirect and Indexed Addressing operations and the implementation of Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode for many of the standard PIC18 instructions.\nThe additional features of the extended instruction set are disabled by default. To enable them, users must set the XINST Configuration bit.\nThe instructions in the extended set can all be classified as literal operations, which either manipulate the File Select Registers, or use them for Indexed Addressing. Two of the instructions, ADDFSR and SUBFSR, each have an additional special instantiation for using FSR2. These versions (ADDULNK and SUBULNK) allow for automatic return after execution.\nThe extended instructions are specifically implemented to optimize re-entrant program code (that is, code that is recursive or that uses a software stack) written in high-level languages, particularly C. Among other things, they allow users working in high-level languages to perform certain operations on data structures more efficiently. These include:",

Detailed descriptions are provided in Extended Instruction Set. The opcode field descriptions in Standard Instruction Set apply to both the standard and extended PIC18 instruction sets.\nImportant: The instruction set extension and the Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode were designed for optimizing applications written in C; the user may likely never use these instructions directly in assembler. The syntax for these commands is provided as a reference for users who may be reviewing code that has been generated by a compiler.",
    "38.2.1 Extended Instruction Syntax\nMost of the extended instructions use indexed arguments, using one of the File Select Registers and some offset to specify a source or destination register. When an argument for an instruction serves as part of Indexed Addressing, it is enclosed in square brackets ('[ ]'). This is done to indicate that the argument is used as an index or offset. MPASM \u2122 Assembler will flag an error if it determines that an index or offset value is not bracketed.\nWhen the extended instruction set is enabled, brackets are also used to indicate index arguments in byte-oriented and bit-oriented instructions. This is in addition to other changes in their syntax. For more details, see Extended Instruction Syntax with Standard PIC18 Commands.\nImportant: In the past, square brackets have been used to denote optional arguments in the PIC18 and earlier instruction sets. In this text and going forward, optional arguments are denoted by braces ('{ }').\n\nTable 38-3. Extensions to the PIC18 Instruction Set",

    "38.2.3 Byte-Oriented and Bit-Oriented Instructions in Indexed Literal Offset Mode\nImportant: Enabling the PIC18 instruction set extension may cause legacy applications to behave erratically or fail entirely.\nIn addition to eight new commands in the extended set, enabling the extended instruction set also enables Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode (Section 'Indexed Addressing with Literal Offset'). This has a significant impact on the way that many commands of the standard PIC18 instruction set are interpreted.\nWhen the extended set is disabled, addresses embedded in opcodes are treated as literal memory locations: either as a location in the Access Bank ('a' = 0 ), or in a GPR bank designated by the BSR ('a' = 1 ). When the extended instruction set is enabled and 'a' = 0 , however, a file register argument of 5Fh or less is interpreted as an offset from the pointer value in FSR2 and not as a literal address. For practical purposes, this means that all instructions that use the Access RAM bit as an argument that is, all byte-oriented and bit-oriented instructions, or almost half of the core PIC18 instructions may behave differently when the extended instruction set is enabled.",
    "38.2.3 Byte-Oriented and Bit-Oriented Instructions in Indexed Literal Offset Mode\nWhen the content of FSR2 is 00h, the boundaries of the Access RAM are essentially remapped to their original values. This may be useful in creating backward compatible code. If this technique is used, it may be necessary to save the value of FSR2 and restore it when moving back and forth between C and assembly routines in order to preserve the Stack Pointer. Users must also keep in mind the syntax requirements of the extended instruction set (see Extended Instruction Syntax with Standard PIC18 Commands).\nAlthough the Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode can be very useful for dynamic stack and pointer manipulation, it can also be very annoying if a simple arithmetic operation is carried out on the wrong register. Users who are accustomed to the PIC18 programming must keep in mind that, when the extended instruction set is enabled, register addresses of 5Fh or less are used for Indexed Literal Offset Addressing.\nRepresentative examples of typical byte-oriented and bit-oriented instructions in the Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode are provided on the following page to show how execution is affected. The operand conditions shown in the examples are applicable to all instructions of these types.",
    "38.2.3.1 Extended Instruction Syntax with Standard PIC18 Commands\nWhen the extended instruction set is enabled, the file register argument, 'f', in the standard byteoriented and bit-oriented commands is replaced with the literal offset value, 'k'. As already noted, this occurs only when 'f' is less than or equal to 5Fh. When an offset value is used, it must be indicated by square brackets ('[ ]'). As with the extended instructions, the use of brackets indicates to the compiler that the value is to be interpreted as an index or an offset. Omitting the brackets, or using a value greater than 5Fh within brackets, will generate an error in the MPASM assembler.\nIf the index argument is properly bracketed for Indexed Literal Offset Addressing, the Access RAM argument is never specified; it will automatically be assumed to be ' 0 '. This is in contrast to standard operation (extended instruction set disabled) when 'a' is set on the basis of the target address. Declaring the Access RAM bit in this mode will also generate an error in the MPASM assembler.\nThe destination argument, 'd', functions as before.",
    "38.2.3.1 Extended Instruction Syntax with Standard PIC18 Commands\nIn the latest versions of the MPASM \u2122 assembler, language support for the extended instruction set must be explicitly invoked. This is done with either the command-line option, /y, or the PE directive in the source listing.",

    "38.2.4 Considerations when Enabling the Extended Instruction Set\nIt is important to note that the extensions to the instruction set may not be beneficial to all users. In particular, users who are not writing code that uses a software stack may not benefit from using the extensions to the instruction set.\nAdditionally, the Indexed Literal Offset Addressing mode may create issues with legacy applications written to the PIC18 assembler. This is because instructions in the legacy code may attempt to address registers in the Access Bank below 5Fh. Since these addresses are interpreted as literal offsets to FSR2 when the instruction set extension is enabled, the application may read or write to the wrong data addresses.\nWhen porting an application to the PIC18(L)F65/66K40 it is very important to consider the type of code. A large, re-entrant application that is written in 'C' and would benefit from efficient compilation will do well when using the instruction set extensions. Legacy applications that heavily use the Access Bank will most likely not benefit from using the extended instruction set.",

All specified values are based on characterization data for that particular oscillator type under standard operating conditions with the device executing code. Exceeding these specified limits may result in an unstable oscillator operation and/or higher than expected current consumption. All devices are tested to operate at 'min' values with an external clock applied to OSC1 pin. When an external clock input is used, the 'max' cycle time limit is 'DC' (no clock) for all devices.\n2. The system clock frequency (FOSC) is selected by the 'main clock switch controls' as described in the 'Power Saving Operation Modes' section.\n3. The system clock frequency (FOSC) must meet the voltage requirements defined in the \"Standard Operating Conditions\" section.\n4. LP, XT and HS oscillator modes require an appropriate crystal or resonator to be connected to the device. For clocking the device with the external square wave, one of the EC mode selections must be used.",
